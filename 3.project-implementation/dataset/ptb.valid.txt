 the k-nearest-neighbor learning algorithm is very simple to implement, requires little in the way of tuning, and often performs quite well 
 the key to htn planning, then, is the construction of a plan library containing known methods for implementing complex, high-level actions

 uncertainty that is, a distribution over y can be obtained by summing out all the other variables from any joint distribution containing y 
 unfortunately, in many hypothesis spaces, the number of examples and the computation time required to reach the true function are enormous 
 until the early NNNNs, the main purpose of decision analysis was to help humans make decisions that actually reflect their own preferences 
 we are then guaranteed to be able to choose a value for xN because the graph is N-consistent, for xs because it is N-consistent, and so on 
 we can identify gaits (a friend's walk), expressions (a smile, a grimace), gestures (aperson waving), actions (jumping, dancing) and so on

 another way to understand what's going on is to see that the agent's belief state is alwtzys fully observable--it always knows what it knows 
 any image will typically contain multiple objects, so we need first to partition it into subsets of pixels that correspond to single objects

 this final query will return a complete input-output table for the device, which can be used to check that it does in fact add its inputs correctly 
 this gets closest to what we really want to measure, but it has the disadvantage that each experiment requires a fresh batch of human test subjects 
 this is useful because rather than considering in advance every we assume that most readers face similar problems and can sympathize with our agent 
 this loses the flexibility of partially ordered plans; also, by increasing the number of time steps in the plan, computation time may be lengthened 
 this notion is actually slightly problematic, because the notion of a computation or effective procedure really cannot be given a formal definition 
 this section will concentrate on feed-forward networks; some pointers for further reading on recurrent networks are given at the end of the chapter 
 this strategy worked initially because microworlds contained very few objects and hence very few possible actions and very short solution sequences

 put another way, we are specifying the truth value of each fluent in the next state as a function of the action and the truth value in the current state 
 random variables play a role similar to that of csp variables in constraint satisfaction problems and that of proposition symbols in propositional logic 
 recent years have been characterized by incremental progress, larger data sets and models, and more rigorous competitions on more realistic speech tasks

 the goal of edge detection is to abstract away from the messy, multi-megabyte image and towards a more compact, abstract representation, as in figure NN 
 the modern view of natural language is that it serves a somewhat different purpose, namely as a medium for communication rather than pure representation 
 the most famous, called tit-fortit-for-tat tat, calls for starting with refuse and then echoing the other player's previous move on all subsequent moves 
 the proof of the incompleteness theorem is somewhat beyond the scope of this book, occupying, as it does, at least NN pages, but we can give a hint here

 the unpredictability of these other agents can introduce many possible colntingencies into the agent's problemsolving process, as discussed in chapter N 
 there are many variants of semantic networks, but all are capable of representing individual objects, categories of objects, and relations among objects 
 there, however, we were concerned with turn-talung games with perfect information, for which minimax search can be used to find gametheory optimal moves 
 they appear implicitly in the network topology, however; for example, success(jones) has fame(profsmith) as a parent because advisor(jones) is profsmith 
 this is because there is always a sequence of flips leading to a satisfying assignment, and eventually the random walk steps will generate that sequence 
 this is only to be expected, and it is similar to the way in which racing cars restricted by engine capacity have evolved into extremely complex designs 
 to reiterate, the aim of the chinese room argument is to refute strong ai-the claim that running the right sort of program necessarily results in a mind 
 to the extent that an agent relies on the prior knowledge of its designer rather than autonomy on its own percepts, we say that the agent lacks autonomy 
 to understand the design of effectors, it will help first to talk about motion and shape in the abstract, using the concept of a degree of freedom (dof) 
 to understand the nature of the relaxed problem, we need to understand exactly what it means for a literal g to appear at level s, in the planning graph 
 under dreyfus's view, human expertise does include knowledge of some rules, but only as a "holistic context" or "background" within which humans operate 
 we assume that ihe variable s ranges over situations, a ranges over actions, o over objects (including agents), gr over gold, and x and y over locations 
 we can show that this algorithm is consistent-gives the correct probabilities as n tends to infinity-by considering what happens during one update cycle 
 we shall see later in the chapter how to construct more sophisticated heuristics that examine the available actions as well as the structure of the goal 
 we should point out, before the reader becomes alarmed, that a fully automated taxi is currently somewhat beyond the capabilities of existing technology

 alpha-beta incorporates the simplest kind of metareasoning, namely, a theorem to the effect that certain branches of the tree can be ignored without loss 
 although this looks like a first-order sentence, it is, in a sense, propositional, because it contains just one variable and all the predicates are unary 
 aN was founded in part as a rebellion against the limitations of existing fields like control theory and statistics, but now it is embracing those fields 
 another clear example of the difference is the case where n(s) is calculated using, say, depthNN look-ahead search with an approximate utility function u 
 another way of saying this is that the result of the query p(johncalls/ burglary = true) is unchanged if we remove mary calls from the network altogether 
 basically, the existential sentence says there is some object satisfying a conditioln, and the instantiation process is just giving a name to that object 
 because the decision problem is sequential, the utility function will depend on a sequence of states-an environment history-rather than on a single state 
 because the transition and sensor models are assumed to be stationary-the same for all t-it is most convenient simply to specify them for the first slice 
 courses of action that don't reach bucharest on time can be rejected without further consideration and the agent's decision problem is greatly simplified 
 do not be confused by the fact that bayes' rule leads us to consider p(ef) rather than p(fje), making it seem as if we were translating french to english

 fluents and objects we mentioned that physical objects can be viewed as generalized events, in the sense that a physical object is a chunk: of space-time 
 for example, a system that allows linear inequalities on real-valued variables might include a linear programming algorithm for solving those constraints 
 for example, if the query is [couch], it would be a shame to exclude from the result set those documents that mention "couch" or "couches" but not "couch

 however, we allow the value of a variable to be a function; for example, if the value of the variable f is the square root function, then f (N) returns N 
 if flies(superman) is a logical sentence, we can't say believes(lois, flies(superman)), because only terms (not sentences) can be arguments of predicates

 instead, most evaluation functions compute separate numerical contributions from each feature and then combine them to find materialvalue the total value 
 it is a reasonable approach when there is no reason to prefer one hypothesis over another a priori-for example, when allN hypotheses are equally coinplex 
 it is also clear that the process can be continued for networks with more than one hidden layer, which justifies the general algorithm given in figure NN 
 it is possible to bound the probability of failure in terms of the number of points generated and certain geometric properties of the configuration space 
 it is reasonable to suppose, however, that a book called what first-order logical rule-based systems without learning can't do might have had less impact

 model-based reflex agents the most effective way to handle partial observability is for the agent to keep track of the part of the world it can't see now 
 N introduces a simple new environment, the wumpus world, and illustrates the operation of a knowledge-based agent without going into any technical detail 
 N, we will see that pragmatics allows us to interpret "it is dead as meaning that the wumpus is dead if we are in a situation where the wumpus is salient 
 nonetheless, this number of steps in the planning graph provides a good estimate of how difficult it is to achieve a given literal from the initial state 
 note that, because the object distance z is typically much greater than the image distance N' or f, we often make the following approximation: section NN 
 notice the use of the binary function symbol "+" in the term +(m, N); in ordinary mathematics, the infix term would be written m + N using infix notation

 now suppose that we are choosing between two different winding dirt roads of slightly different lengths and we are carrying a seriously injured passenger 
 on the other hand, it is also important not to get too concerned with the specijics of logical notation-after all, there are dozens of different versions 
 other algorithms soon followed, including an approach due to hansen (NNNN) that constructs a policy incrementally in the form of a finite-state automaton 
 otherwise, if the count is larger than that of the lo'west entry in the priority queue, we delete the lowest entry and add the new (document, count) pair

 the algoritlm seems pike magic at first, but once the intuition has been developed, one can find applications for em in a huge range of learning problems 
 the assumption of independence is unreasonable, because hypotheses are likely to be misled in the same way by any misleading aspects of the training data 
 the chapters on first-order logic have been reorganized to present the material more clearly and we have added the internet shopping domain as an example 
 the current-besthypothesis approach maintains a single hypothesis, specializing it when it proves too broad and generalizing it when it proves too narrow

 the map (or mdl) approach simply subtracts a penalty from the likelihood of each structure (after parameter tuning) before comparing different structures 
 the partial-order solution corresponds to six possible linearization total-order plans; each of these is called a linearization of the partial-order plan 
 the problem can be avoided by standardizing apart one of the two sentences beiing unified, which means renaming its apart variables to avoid name clashes 
 the residual term can be taken outside the integral, giving us now the integral is just the integral of a gaussian over its full range, which is simply N

 the wumpus world NNN as we mentioned in the introduction to the chapter, one can build a knowledge-based agent simply by telirzg it what it needs to know 
 there are Nn physical states, so there are N" belief states-far more than N", so options N and N are quite restricted as representations of belief states 
 these increases come about mainly because the derived rules avoid dead ends that would otherwise be taken, but also because they shorten the proof itself 
 this by itself is not remarkable--replacing x by f (x) in any learning algorithm has the required effect- but the dot product has some special properties 
 this can be as simple as a ranked list of document titles or as complex as a rotating color map of the result set projected onto a threedimensional space 
 this is a useful quantity if we want to compare different temporal models that might have produced the same evidence sequence; for example, in section NN 
 this is because the agent must maximize the (discounted) sum of all future rewards, and u(xt+N) represents the reward for xt+N and all subsequent rewards 
 this is in contrast to natural languages, such as chinese, danish, and english, that have no strict definition but are used by a community NNN chapter NN 
 this is multiplied by kt+l to correct the predicted state; hence &+i is a measure of how seriously to take the new observation relative to the prediction 
 this, in turn, gradually decreases the uncertainty in the mapping of new landmarks that are nearby, which then allows the robot to explore more territory

 we can show that, under this mechanism, the dominant strategy for each player is to report c, truthfully and that doing so will result in a cheapest path 
 whenever the control program reaches a nondeterministic choice point, a planner (in the form of a theorem prover) is invoked to determine what to do next 
 whenever there is a large set of possible hypotheses, one has to be careful not to use the resulting freedom to find meaningless "regularity" in the data

 of course, we can insert a test into the algorithm, but this merely hides the underlying problem: many of the calculations done by alpha-beta are largely irrelevant 
 on the other hand, the decision-tree learner makes no progress, because the majority function is very hard (although not impossible) to represent as a decision tree 
 on the other hand, we will assume that the agent does not know how the environment works or what its actions do, and we will allow for probabilistic action outcomes 
 once exact values are known, optimal decisions can be taken simply by moving to the highest-valued successor-that is, pure hill climbing is then an optimal strategy 
 one obvious choice is to order the variables in their natural temporal order, since cause usually precedes effect and we prefer to add the variables in causal order 
 one sollution is for each agent to randomize its choice between moving forward and staying put; the stalemate will be resolved quickly and both agents will be happy

 another way to say this is that there might be a solution through pitesti whose cost is as low as NNN, so the algorithm will not settle for a solution that costs NNN 
 another way to think about the problem is this: the advantage of alpha-beta is that it ignores future developments that just are not going to happen, given best play

 third, and most importantly, even if we grant that computers have limitations on what they can prove, there is no evidence that humans are immune from those limitations 
 this alleviates the problem of semi-decidability to some extent, because the supervisor can cancel a query and try another approach if the query is taking too much time 
 this approach seems to work better than satplan, presumably because the planning graph has already eliminated many of the impossible states and actions from the problem 
 this is a consequence of literals' increasing; if the preconditions of an action appear at one level, they will appear at subsequent levels, and thus so will the action 
 this process is called extending a causal link and is done whenever a condition can be supplied by an earlier step instead of a later one without causing a new conflict

 if we always allow sideways moves when there are no uphill moves, an infinite loop will occur whenlever the algorithm reaches a flat local maximum that is not a shoulder 
 if we train on all our available examples, then we will have to go out and get some more to test on, so often it is more convenient to adopt the following methodology: N 
 in games with dice, there are no likely sequences of moves, because for those moves to take place, the dice would first have to come out the right way to make them legal 
 in particular, we introduce a formalism called decision networks (also known as influence diagrams) that extends bayesian networks by incorporating actions and utilities

 in general, after the first attribute test splits up the examples, each outcome is a new decision tree learning problem in itself, with fewer examples and one fewer attribute 
 in logic, a sentence such as "the patient has a cavity" is true or false depending on the interpretation and the world; it is true just when the fact it refers to is the case

 this is similar to the precedence used in arithmetic-for example, ab + c is read as ((ab) + c) rather than a(b + c) because multiplication has higher precedence than addition 
 this means that the next state xt+l must be a linear function of the current state xt, plus some gaussian noise, a condition that turns out to be quite reasonable in practice 
 this restriction means that we cannot use complex functions such as father and mother, which lead to potentially infinite chains that would have to end with an unknown object

 in chapter N we remedied the poor performance of uninformed search algorithms by supplying them with domain-specific heuristic functions derived from our knowledge of the problem 
 in particular, if an action occurs, one of whose preconditions is mknown, then the resulting belief state will not be exactly representable and the action outcome becomes unknown

 the agent can use this information to consider subsequent stages of a hypothetical journey via each of the three towns, trying to find a journey that eventually gets to bucharest 
 the best-known category is that of linear programming problems, in which constraints must be linear inequalities forming a convex region and the objective function is also linear 
 the first kind of difficulty arose because most early programs contained little or no knowledge of their subject matter; they succeeded by means of simple syntactic manipulations

 the m-step, or maximization step, finds the new values of the parameters that maximize the log likelihood of the data, given the expected values of the hidden indicator variables 
 the major points are as follows: a large-scale knowledge representation requires a general-purpose ontology to organize and tie together the various specific domains of knowledge 
 the majority of learning research in ai, computer science, and psychology has studied the case in which the agent begins with no knowledge at all about what it is trying to learn 
 the other is illumination invariance-within a suitable range of contrasts, the edges will be detected at roughly the same locations, independent of precise lighting configuration 
 the principal differences are that (N) we condition explicitly on the actions as well as the observations, and (N) we must now deal with continuous rather than discrete variables 
 the reader might have noticed an obvious drawback of semantic network notation, compared to first-order logic: the fact that links between bubbles represent only binary relations 
 the second approach, which we will pursue, is to achieve effective opacity within syntactic theory a referentially transparent language using a syntactic theory of mental objects 
 the second step is to abstract over the implementation, to find some measure that reflects the running time of the algorithm, but is not tied to a particular compiler or computer 
 the study of this relation was intended to inductive logic colstitute a mathematical discipline called inductive logic, analogous to ordinary deductive logic (carnap, NNNN, NNNN) 
 this is because the single test, cleanl, suffices to divide the states at the and-node into two singleton sets, so that after the test the agent knows exactly what state it is in 
 unfortunately, its time complexity for a network with n boolean variables is always N(N*)-better than the No(nN") for the simple approach described earlier, but still rather grim

 " instead of dealing with explicit times like t N N, we will concentrate in this section on situations, which denote situation calculus the states resulting from executing actions 
 " the logic of relations was studied in depth by charles sanders peirce (NNNN), who also developed first-order logic independently of frege, although slightly later (peirce, NNNN) 
 (of course, the assumption of linearity implies that the price becomes negative at some point; the linear model is reasonable only if the harvest size is limited to a narrow range

 early aN implementations put a good deal of effort into data structures that would allow efficient retrieval of facts; this work is covered in aN programming texts (charniak et al 
 first-order logic makes it easy to state facts about categories, either by relating objects to categories or by quantifying over their members: an object is a member of a category 
 first, we need some information about how the world evolves independently of the agent-for example, that an overtalung car generally will be closer behind than it was a moment ago 
 for example, from its green, mottled skin, large size, and ovoid shape, one can infer that an object is a watermelon; from this, one infers that it would be useful for fruit salad

 for this particular problem, greedy best-first search using hsld finds a solution without ever expanding a node that is not on the solution path; hence, its search cost is minimal 
 from these examples, an inductive learning algorithm can be used to construct a function h(n) that can (with luck) predict solution costs for other states that arise during search 
 in general, for ci and ci to have any resolvents, they must be constructed by first applying to cN and cN the most general unifier of a pair of complementary literals in cN and cN

 NN-NN) while it is easy to agree that computer simulations of storms do not make us wet, it is not clear how to carry this analogy over to computer simulations of mental processes 
 notice that there are no chance nodes corresponding to the action outcomes; this is because the belief state update for an action is deterministic regardless of the actual outcome 
 notice that, because the cost of taking a step is fairly small compared with the penalty for ending up in (N,N) by accident, the optimal policy for the state (N,l) is conservative 
 now, N in generalized modus ponens is defined so that subst($, pi') = subst($, pi), for all i; therefore the first of these two sentences matches the premise of the second exactly 
 on the other hand, correct inference is not all of rationality, because there are often situations where there is no provably correct thing to do, yet something must still be done 
 on top of this, it provides a much broader range of constructs for defining communication flow and synchronization constraints between different modules than the behavior language 
 one might think that evaluation functions for games such as backgammon slhould be just like evaluation functions for chess-they just need to give higher scores to better positions 
 one of the challenging aN tasks studied with this platroboticoccer form is robotic soccer, a competitive game very much like human soccer, but played with autonomous mobile robots 
 percept as input because nothing more is available from the environment; if the agent's actions depend on the entire percept sequence, the agent will have to remember the percepts

 show that they can indeed be answered by the kb, and include in your report a discussion of the fixes, explaining why they were needed, whether they were minor or major, and so on 
 so we divide the work: syntactic and semantic interpretation is responsible for enumerating a set of candidate interpretations, and the disambiguation process chooses the best one 
 the complexity of constructing the planning graph is a low-order polynomial in the number of actions and literals, whereas the state space is exponential in the number of literals 
 the estimate might not be very good, however, because planning graphs allow several actions at each level whereas the heuristic counts just the level and not the number of actions 
 the fact that the rules found by ilp can be interpreted by humans contributes to the: acceptance of these techniques in biology journals rather than just computer science journals 
 the key assumption is that the training and test sets are drawn randomly and independently from the same popstationarity ulation of examples with the same probability distribution

 this is an procedural attachment example of a general technique called procedural attachment, whereby particular predicates and functions can be handled by special-purpose methods 
 this method eliminates the problem of zero-probability n-grams, but the assumption that every count should be incrernented by exactly one is dubious and can lead to poor estimates 
 to keep things simple, one might assume gaussian noise with covariance 'c, a somewhat different sensor model is often appropriate for range scanners of the kind shown in figure NN 
 we backjump to q, and q absorbs the conflict set from sa (minus q itself, of course) into its own direct conflict set, which is {nt, ns w); the new conflict set is { wa, nt, nsmt) 
 we can formalize this by introducing the predicate poseflect(a, fi), meaning that action a causes fi to become true, and negeflect (a, fi) meaning that a causes fi to become false 
 we can think of the filtered estimate p(xt/el,t) as a "message" fl:t that is propagated forward along the sequence, modified by each transition and updated by each new observation 
 we have seen that a game can have more than one nash equilibrium; how do we know that every game must have at least one? it can be that a game has no pure-strategy nash equilibria 
 we should not assume that this is the definitive utility function for monetary value, but it is likely that most people have a utility function that is concave for positive wealth 
 we showed that the design problem depends on the percepts and actions available to the agent, the goals that the agent's behavior should satisfy, and the nature of the environment 
 we will assume that transitions are markovian in the sense of chapter NN, that is, the probability of reaching s' from s depends only on s and not on the history of earlier states 
 yet the same average cleanliness can be achieved by two different agents, one of which does a mediocre job all the time: while the other cleans energetically but takes long breaks 
 " if the neighborhood is too small, it wom't contain any data points; too large, and it may include all the data points, resulting in a density estimate that is the same everywhere 
 (viewing htn planning as an extension of partial-order plainning has the additional advantage that we can use the same notational conventions instead of introducing a whole new set 
 a better understanding of the problems and their complexity properties, combined with increased mathematical sophistication, has led to workable research agendas and robust methods

 one interesting finding from this work has been that backtracking algorithms such as dpll are often better at solving planning problems than local search algorithms such as walksat 
 one might, in a moment of pure accountancy, dismiss such properties as useless for the ]purpose of logical reasoning; or, still worse, attempt to impose a numerical scale on beauty 
 only primary effects secondary effect may be used to achieve goals, whereas both kinds of effects might cause conflicts with other actions; this can greatly reduce the search space 
 others focus on intentionality-that is, the question of whether the machine's purported beliefs, desires, and other representations are actually "about" something in the real world 
 the approach was used in the m-dendral expert system for chemistry (buchanan and mitchell, NNNN), and later in mitchell's (NNNN) lex system, which learns to solve calculus problems

 the first general-purpose mobile robot was "shakey," developed at what was then the stanford research institute (now sri) in the late NNNNs (fikes and nilsson, NNNN; nilsson, NNNN) 
 the flexible ordering also makes it easier to combine smaller plans into larger ones, because each of the small plans can reorder its actions to avoid conflict with the other plans 
 the form can be justified by proposing that the underlying decision process has a hard threshold, but that the precise location of the threshold is subject to random gaussian noise 
 the initial state has the robot in the right square of a clean world; because the environment is fully observable, the agent knows the full state description, atr a cleanl a cleanr

 then, when an unknown example is presented, we can compare its color complete rotation invariance is neither necessary nor desirable-one might then confuse a N with a N! section NN 
 they can be ignored because the goal proposition, appears only in sentence rN; the other propositions in rN appear only in rN and rN; so rN, rN, and rN have no bearing on the proof 
 they use a complete-state formulation: the initial state assigns a value to every variable, and the successor function usually works by changing the value of one variable at a time 
 this belief could be derived from statistical data-NN% of the toothache patients seen so far have had cavities-or from some general rules, or from a combination of evidence sources 
 this fundamental result can also be interpreted as showing that there are some functions on the integers that cannot be represented by an algorithm-that is, they cannot be computed 
 this means that learning with noisy-or (or other compactly parameterized) models tends to produce learned structures with more parents than does learning with tabular distributions 
 thus, the viterbi algorithm solves the word segmentation problem by using dynamic programming to consider (in effect) all possible word sequences and word boundaries simultaneously 
 to achieve this, we have to define an attractive force that pulls the robot towards its goal configuration and a repellent potential field that pushes the robot away from obstacles

 the substitution N that is the argument to unify is built up along the way and is used to make sure that later comparisons are consistent with bindings that were established earlier 
 the symbols, therefore, come in three kinds: constant symbols, which stand for objects; predicate symbols, which stand for relations; and function symbols, which stand for functions 
 there could be more subtle flaws involving three, four, or more actions, but experience has shown that it is not worth the computational effort to keep track of these possible flaws

 this degree of ignorance can be reduced in some applications-for example, a robot explorer might know how its movement actions work and be ignorant only of the locations of obstacles 
 this kind of reasoning is said to nonmonotongity exhibit nonmonotonicity, because the set of beliefs does not grow monotonically over time lnonmonotonic ogics as new evidence arrives

 notice that this works not only for clear-favorite situations, but also for the case of symmetrical moves, for which no amount of search will show that one move is better than another 
 obviously, a prediction is good if it turns out to be true, so we can assess the quality of a hypothesis by checking its predictions against the correct classification once we know it 
 on the flip side, of course, there is the problem that there could fail to be any function in the chosen hypothesis space that approximates the true utility function sufficiently well 
 one important detail is that actions that have not yet been tried in a state s are always assumed to lead immediately to the tirc:ml$der goal with the least possible cost, namely h(s) 
 one minor difference is that we may have several outputs, so some people call this a three-layer network, and some call it a two-layer network (because the inputs aren't "real" units)

 the parameter variable o determines the probability of each flavori variable: similarly, the wrapper probabilities depend on oN and NN, for example, p( wrapperi = red (flavori = cherry, oN = NN) = oN 
 this is because the value stored in each register gives the truth value of the corresponding proposition symbol at the current time t, rather than having a different copy for each different time step 
 thus, special-purpose logics give certain kinds of objects (and the axioms about them) "first-class" status within the logic, rather than simply defin- higher-Nrder ing them within the knowledge base

 all speech acts affect the world by making air molecules vibrate (or the equivalent effect in some other medium) and thereby changing the mental state and eventually the future actions of other agents 
 alternatively, we can start with an initial guess at the structure and use hill-climbing or simulated annealing search to make modifications, retuning the parameters after each change in the structure 
 although the simplified form contains fewer nodes, the omission of an explicit description of the outcome of the siting decision means that it is less flexible with respect to changes in circumstances

 human agents in particular are notorious for "sour grapesx -believing they did not really want something after not getting it, as in, "oh well, never mind, i didn't want that stupid nobel prize anyway 
 if b -N a' was a causal link in the original plan, replace it by a set of causal links from b to all the steps in dl with preconditions p that were supplied by the start step in the decomposition d (i 
 if the degree of deviation is statistically unlikely (usually taken to mean a N% probability or less), then that is considered to be good evidence for the presence of a significant pattern in the data 
 in addition to planning trips for traveling salespersons, these algorithms have been used for tasks such as planning movements of automatic circuit-board drills and of stocking machines on shop floors 
 in choosing a new value for a variable, the most obvious heuristic is to select the value min-conflicts that results in the minimum number of conflicts with other variables-the min-conflicts heuristic 
 in recent years there has been increased demand for software robots that perform ininternet searching ternet searching, looking for answers to questions, for related information, or for shopping deals 
 in the area of inferring shape from contour, after the key initial contributions of huffman (NNNN) and clowes (NNNN), mackworth (NNNN) and sugihara (NNNN) completed the analysis for polyhedral objects 
 in the best case-when high-level solutions always turn out to have satisfactory low-level implementations-hierarchical methods can result in linear-time instead of exponential-time planning algorithms 
 in the case of differentiation, memoization would remember that the derivative of xN with respect to x is Nx, but would leave the agent to calculate the derivative of zN with respect to z from scratch 
 in the case of rigid objects, whether three-dimensional or two-dimensional, this problem has a simple alignmentmethod and well defined solution based on the alignment method, which we will now develop 
 in the case of the burglary network, the topology shows that burglary and earthquakes directly affect the probability of the alann's going off, but whether john and mary call depends only on the alarm 
 interest in agents and in agent design has risen rapidly in recent years, partly because of the growth of the internet and the perceived need for automated and mobile softbots (etzioni and weld, NNNN) 
 logical foundations of artijicial intelligence (genesereth and nilsson, NNNN) provides both a solid introduction to logic and the first systematic treatment of logical agents with percepts and actions 
 naive bayes learning scales well to very large problems: with n boolean attributes, there are just Nn + N parameters, and no search is required to$nd hml, the maximum-likelihood naive bayes hypothesis 
 of course, the fact that one can write a planner or natural language parser in a few dozen lines of prolog makes it somewhat more desirable than c for prototyping most small-scale aN research projects 
 on hearing him speak portuguese, she immediately concludes that brazilians speak portuguese, yet on discovering that his name is fernando, she does not conclude that all brazilians are called fernando 
 on the other hand, if each action has at most e effects, where e is typically much less than f, then we should be able to represent what happens with a much smaller knowledge base of sfj$al size o(ae) 
 one big problem for top-down parsing is dealing with so-called left-recursive rules-that is, rules of the form x + x with a depth-first search, such a rule would lead us to keep replacing x with [x: x 
 planex used triangle tables-essentially an efficient storage mechanism for the plan preconditions at each point in the plan-to allow recovery from partial execution failure without complete replanning 
 pop can string together primitive actions in arbitrary ways, so we might find ourselves with solutions that are very hard to understand and do not have the nice, hierarchical organization of htn plans 
 prolog is therefore incomplete as a theorem prover for definite clauses-even for datalog programs, as this example showsbecause, for some knowledge bases, it fails to prove sentences that are entailed 
 solving problems by searching contingency problem has no way to tell which outcome actually occurred, so the various possible outcomes are just additional physical states in the successor belief state 
 some of the material in this chapter is fairly mathematical (requiring a basic understanding of multivariate calculus), although the general lessons can be understood without plunging into the details 
 the following examples illustrate these three concepts: disjoint ({animals, vegetables)) exhaustivedecomposition({americans, canadians, mexicans), northamericans) partition ({males, females), animals) 
 the idea is to rewrite the rule set, using information from the goal, so that only relevant magic set variable bindings-those belonging to a so-called magic set-are considered during forward inference 
 the method of dynamic programming (bellman and dreyfus, NNNN), which systematically records solutions for all subproblems of increasing lengths, can be seen as a form of breadth-first search on graphs 
 the neural network does learn well, although not quite as fast as decision-tree learning; this is perhaps not surprising, because the data were generated from a simple decision tree in the first place 
 the problems included representing stereotypical situations (cullingford, NNNN), describing human memory organization (rieger, NNNN; kolodner, NNNN), and understanding plans and goals (wilensky, NNNN) 
 the same holds true for planners: in the worst case, it can take o(n!) time to find the best plan to deliver n packages, but only o((n/k)! x k) time if the problem can be decomposed into k equal parts 
 the whole computation can be done in a dynamic programming 'ns'de-outs'de algorithm fashion with an algorithm called the inside-outside allgoritlhm in analogy to the forwardbackward algorithm for hmms 
 the wumpus world has its spatial component laid out in a two-dimensional grid and has discrete time; our world has three spatial dimensions and one generalized event temporal dirnensin, all continuous 
 there are just N data points, so the polynomial has as many parameters as there are data points: thus, it does not seem to be finding any pattern in the data and we do not expect it to generalize well 
 this kind of backtracking is inevitable, but if our parsing algorithm is to be efficient, it must avoid reanalyzing "the students in section N of computer science NNN" as an np each time it backtracks 
 to avoid a conflict with the causal link from remove(spare, trunk) ( that protects at(spare, ground), leaveovernight is constrained to occur before N remove(spare, trunk), as shown by the dashed arrow

 we know that ithe general triangle inequality is satisfied when each side is measured by the straight-line distance, and that the straight-line distance between n and n' is no greater than c(n, a, n') 
 were devised to take advantage of the structure of the problem-that the input consists of pixels in a two-dimensional array, and that small changes in the position or slant of an image are unimportant 
 work on rule induction, such as the idN (quinlan, NNNN) and cnN (clark and niblett, NNNN) systems, led to foil (quinlan, NNNN), which for the first time allowed practical induction of relational rules 
 a mixture is a weighted sum of k individual distributions, so p(featuresNphone) has k weights, k mean vectors of size n, and k covariance matrices of size nN -that is, o(knN ) parameters for each phone 
 although there are many possible universal turing machines, and hence many possible "shortest" programs, these programs difl'er in length by at most a constant that is independent of the amount of data 
 an open challenge in robotics is the design of robots that can use natural cues, instead of artificial devices, to navigate, particularly in environments such as the deep ocean where gps is unavailable 
 and evidence variables ul , uN, we will use the notation a:b to denote the sequence of integers from a to b (inclusive), and the notation xazb to denote the corresponding set of variables from x, to xb 
 e games of chance can be handled by an extension to the minimax algorithm that evaluates a chance node by taking the average utility of all its children nodes, weighted by the probability of each child 
 for example, each person has one left leg, so the model has a unary "left leg" function that includes the following mappings: (richard the lionheart) t richard's left leg (king john) -+ john's left leg 
 for example, if b = NN and d = N, the numbers are in general, iterative deepening is the preferred uninformed search method when there is a large search space and the depth of the solution is not known 
 for example, if my world consists of only the boolean variables cavity and toothache, then there are just four distinct atomic events; the proposition cavity =false a toothache = true js one such event 
 for example, nature provides an objective function-reproductive fitness-that darwinian evolution could be seen as attempting to optimize, but there is no "goal test" and no "path cost" for this problem 
 fortunately, we can do this (in the graph, not the continent) by fixing a value for sa and deleting from the domains of the other variables any values that are inconsistent with the value chosen for sa 
 if a problem has no solution, can we be sure that graphplan will not loop forever, extending the planning graph at each iteration? the answer is yes, but the full proof is beyond the scope of this book 
 if it starts to rain, the agent can update its knowledge of how effectively its brakes will operate; this will automatically cause all of the relevant behaviors to be altered to suit the new conditions 
 in some cases, however, the causal model may be unavailable or subject to dispute-for example, certain corporations have long claimed that smoking does not cause cancer-so it is important to section NN 
 in spite of the control uncertainty, all possible trajectories of the robot terminate in contact with the bottom of the hole-that is, unless surface irregularities cause the robot to stick in one place 
 it is the potential for interference between quantifiers using the same variable name that motivates the slightly baroque mechanism of extended interpretations in the semantics of quantifi ed sentences 
 it might not always appear that way in the figures, because the figures have a simplification: they display neither literals that cannot hold at level si nor actions that cannot be executed at level ai 
 j=N error the quantity (yj - (bNxj + NN)) is the error for (zj, yj)-that is, the difference between the actual value yj and the predicted value (NN xj + $N)-so e is the well-known sum of squared errors 
 just given this information, aN is clearly preferable, because it is quite likely that the second route is blocked by avalanches, whereas it is quite unlikely that the first route is blocked by traffic 
 making discoveries with inductive logic prograimming an inverse resolution procedure that inverts a complete resolution strategy is, in principle, a complete algorithm for learning first-order theories 
 monotonicity means that inference rules can be applied whenever suitable premises are found in the knowledge base-the conclusion of the rule must follow regardless of what else is in the knowledge base 
 N it is quite often useful to consider the effect of some specific propositions in the context of some general background evidence that remains fixed, rather than in the complete absence of information 
 N, where we have assigned variables in the order wa, nt, q, plain backtracking is an uninformed algorithm in the terminology of chapter N, so we do not expect it to be very effective for large problems 
 nonetheless, there remain inany open issues concerning the proper representation of linguistic observations and continuous quantities-issues that have been neglected by most outside the fuzzy community 
 notice that the restriction to binary relations forces the creation of a rich ontology of reified concepts; indeed, much of the ontology developed in this chapter originated in semantic network systems 
 simplified matrix algorithms with a single, discrete state variable xt, we can give concrete form to the representations of the transition model, the sensor model, and the forw<wd and backward messages 
 since then, there has been increased emphasis on regular grammars, brought about by the need to process megabytes and gigabytes of online text very quickly, even at the cost of a less complete analysis 
 the agent program takes just the current there are other choices for the agent program skeleton; for example, we could have the agent programs be coroutines that run asynchronously with the environment 
 the first known calculating machine was constructed around NNNN by the german scientist wilhelm schickard (NNNN-NNNN), although the pascaline, built in NNNN by blaise pascal (NNNN-NNNN), is more famous 
 the idea of an intermediate or quasi-logical form to handle problems such as quantifier scoping goes back to woods (NNNN) and is present in many recent systems (alshawi, NNNN; hwang and schubert, NNNN) 
 the naive version of the program generated all possible structures consistent with the formula, and then predicted what mass spectrum would be observed for each, comparing this with the actual spectrum 
 the only good reason for keeping them in the lexicon is for systems that support phrase queries: an index of stop words is necessary to efficiently retrieve hits for queries such as "to be or not to be 
 the output value can also be classification discrete or continuous; learning a discrete-valued function is called classification learning; regression learning a continuous function is called regression 
 the problems included representing stereotypical situations (cullingford, NNN i), describing human memory organization (rieger, NNNN; kolodner, NNNN), and understanding plans and goals (wilensky, NNNN) 
 the programs are represented in the form of expression trees; the expressions can be in a standard language such as lisp or can be specialty designed to represent circuits, robot controllers, and so on 
 the remainder of this section hones these ideas, in preparation for the development of the general theories of uncertain reasoning and rational decisions that we present in this and subsequent chapters 
 the simplest kind of repeatedgame multiple-move game is the repeated game, in which players face the same choice repeatedly, but each time with knowledge of the history of all players' previous choices 
 the success of hill climbing depends very much on the shape of the state-space landscape: if there are few local maxima and plateaux, random-restart hill climbing will find a good solution very quickly 
 the text by sutton and barto (NNNN), two of the field's pioneers, focuses on architectures and algorithms, showing how reinforcement learning weaves together the ideas of learning, planning, and acting 
 this is because we always chose to resolve with a clause whose positive literal unified with the leftmost literal of the "current" clause on the spine; this is exactly what happens in backward chaining 
 this is what first led researchers away from probability theory toward approximate methods for evidence combination that, while giving incorrect answers, require fewer numbers to give any answer at all 
 this leads to a deeper notion of the conflict set for a variable such as nt: it is that set of preceding variables that caused nt, together with any subsequent variables, to have no consistent solution 
 to begin to answer such questions, we need ways to talk about brain states at levels more abstract than specific configurations of all the atoms of the brain of a particular person at a particular time 
 truth tables as a method of testing the validity or unsatisfiability of sentences in the language of propositional logic were introduced independently by ludwig wittgenstein (NNNN) and emil post (NNNN) 
 we say that a problem has serializable subgoals if there exists an order of subgoals such that the planner can achieve them in that order, without having to undo any of the previously achieved subgoals 
 you should allow for some tailoring to individual students, in that your system should ask what courses or equivalents the student has already taken, and not generate programs that repeat those courses 
 , such as at (pi, x) a at (pN, x), where x ranges over a finite domain of locations? how could you encode such a problem to work with planning graphs? (hint: remember the finish action from pop planning 
 an interval, such as the twentiethcentury, has a fixed, limited temporal extent and maximal spatial extent, and a place, such as australia, has a roughly fixed spatial extent and maximal temporal extent 
 chapter NN explained how probability and first-order logic can be combined to solve this problem; we expect that the application of these ideas for tracking complex environments will yield huge benefits 
 chomsky showed how the behaviorist theory did not address the notion of creativity in language-it did not explain how a child could understand and make up sentences that he or she had never heard before 
 complete syntactic and semantic analysis of the utterances is necessary to extract the full meaning of the utterances, and is possible because the utterances are short and restricted to a limited domain 
 cooper (NNNN) showed that the general problem of inference in unconstrained bayesian networks is np-hard, and paul dagum and mike luby (NNNN) showed the corresponding approximation problem to be np-hard 
 currently, it is believed that no unique inductive logic exists; rather, any such logic rests on a subjective prior probability distribution whose effect is diminished as more observations are collected 
 for example, if the symbol np appears NNN,NNN times, and there are NN,NNN instances of np with the list of children [np, pp], then create the rule the task is much harder if all we have is unparsed text 
 for example, if we were interested in debugging faulty circuits, then it would probably be a good idea to include the wires in the ontology, because a faulty wire can corrupt the signal flowing along it 
 for this reason, the code repository also includes an environment generator for each environment generator class that selects particular environments (with certain likelihoods) in which to run the agent 
 from the point of view of decision analysis, the interesting thing is not how close your median guesses came to the real answers, but rather how often the real answer came within your NN% and NN% bounds 
 iin this particular variant of the genetic algorithm, ithe probability of being chosen for reproducing is directly proportional to the fitness score, and the percentages are shown next to the raw scores 
 in general, the completion will contain a definition-an if-and-only-if sentence-for each predicate, and each definition will contain a disjunct for each definite clause having that predrcate in its head 
 in this approach, multiple filter kalman filters run in parallel, each using a different model of the system-for example, one for straight flight, one for sharp left turns, and one for sharp right turns 
 it appears (glanc, NNNN) that it was actually capek's brother, josef, who first combined the czech words "robota" (obligatory work) and "robotnik," (serf) to yield "robot" in his NNNN short story opilec 
 it uses action actionmonitoring monitoring: before carrying out the next action of plan, the agent examines its percepts to see whether any preconditions of the plan have unexpectedly become unsatisfied 
 most comparisons of genetic algorithms to other approaches (especially stochastic hillclimbing) have found that the genetic algorithms are slower to converge (o'reilly and oppacher, NNNN; mitchell et al

 physicists such as john hopfield (NNNN) used techniques from statistical mechanics to analyze the storage and optimization properties of networks, treating collections of nodes like collections of atoms 
 planning and acting in the real world it is relatively straightforward to modify a planning algorithm so that it annotates the plan at each point with the preconditions for success of the remaining plan 
 position evaluation in games with chance nodes as with minimax, the obvious approximation to make with expectiminimax is to cut the search off at some point and apply an evaluation function to each leaf 
 similar considerations apply to the development of human language, where the important thing is not which language each indavidual should speak, but the fact that all individuals speak the same language 
 the basic idea of memo functions is to accumulate a database of inputloutput pairs; when the function is called, it first checks the database to see whether it can avoid solving the problem from scratch 
 the conditional planning approach described in the chapter is based on the efficient search algorithms for cyclic and-or graphs developed by jirrtenez and torras (NNNN) and hansen and zilberstein (NNNN) 
 the distribution of candies in each bag is described by a naive bayes model: the features are independent, given the bag, but the conditional probability distribution for each feature depends on the bag 
 the more general case of multivalued variables can be written in the p notatioin as where again this is to be taken as representing a set of equations, each dealing with specific values of the variables 
 the most obvious approach is to conduct a search through the space of determinations, checking all determinations with one predicate, two predicates, and so on, until a consistent determination is found 
 this chapter shows how to use knowledge about the wlorld to make decisions even when the outcomes of an action are uncertain and the rewards for acting might not be reaped until many actions have passed 
 this illustrates the first issue in inductive learning: how do we choose from among multiple consistent hypotheses? one answer is ockham'sN razor: prefer the simplest hypothesis consistent with the data 
 this important step checks whether the best decision is sensitive to small changes in the assigned probabilities and utilities by systematically varying those parameters and running the evaluation again 
 turing also examined a wide variety of possible objections to the possibility of intelligent machines, including virtually all of those that have been raised in the half century since his paper appeared 
 when the unit preference strategy was first tried for propositional inference in NNNN, it led to a dramatic speedup, making it feasible to prove theorems that could not be handled without the preference 
 with the completion and the unique names assumption (and the obvious definition of the integer predicate), we get the desired conclusion that there are exactly NN courses: NN ee courses and N cs courses 
 , elkan, NNNN) argue that these applications are successful because they have small rule bases, no chaining of inferences, and tunable parameters ithat can be adjusted to improve the system's performance

 " in NNNN, james marwell said "the true logic for this world is the calculus of probabilities, which takes account of the magnitude of the probability which is, or ought to be, in a reasonable man's mind 
 ) shading shading-variation in the intensity of light received from different portions of a surface in a scene-is determined by the geometry of the scene and by the reflectance properties of the surfaces 
 ) this kind of exhaustive analysis can be done by hand for N x N tic-tac-toe and has been done by computer for qubic (N x N x N tic-tac-toe), go-moku (five in a row), and nine-men's morris (gasser, NNNN) 
 a formal analysis of ilp methods appears in mulggleton (NNNN), a large collection of papers in muggleton (NNNN), and a collection of techniques and applications in the book by lavrai: and dieroski (NNNN) 
 agent N proposition belief one might argue that the agent's preferences for different bank balances are such that the possibility of losing $N is not counterbalanced by an equal possibility of winning $N 
 although mccarthy (NNNN) had suggested the use of first-order logic for representaition and reasoning in ai, the first such systems were developed by logicians interested in ]mathematical theorem proving 
 although version space methods are probably not practical in most real-world learning problems, mainly because of noise, they provide a good deal of insight into the logical structure of hypothesis space 
 among the huge variety of games, we will focus on those in which cards are dealt randomly at the beginning of the game, with each player receiving a hand of cards that is not visible to the other players 
 an inconsistency can be detected simply by checlung the sum of the minimum values of the current domains; for example, if each variable has the domain {N,N,N,N), the utmost constraint cannot be satisfied 
 as rule sets became larger, undesirable interactions between rules became more common, and practitioners found that the certainty factors of many other rules had to be "tweaked" when new rules were added 
 categories and objects NNN objects from perceptual input, infers category membership from the perceived properties of the objects, and then uses category information to make predictions about the objects 
 constructing dbns to construct a dbn, one must specify three kinds of information: the prior distribution over the state variables, p(xo); the transition model p(xt+l lxt); and the sensor model p(et ixt) 
 each data point consists of an observation sequence of finite length, so the problem is to learn the transition probabilities from a set of observation sequences (or possibly from just one long sequence) 
 for example, if the umbrella appears on each of the first three days and is absent on the fourth, then the most likely explanation is that it rained on the first three days and did not rain on the fourth 
 if the knowledge base contains many objects owned by nono and very few missiles, however, it would be better to find all the missiles first conjunct ordering and then check whether they are owned by nono 
 if we assume that the environment is really nondeterministic, in the sense that such a plan always has some chance of success on any given execution attempt, then the agent will eventually reach the goal 
 in the logical case, the semantic definition of conjunction means that at least one of the three beliefs just mentioned must be false in the world, so it is unreasonable for an agent to believe all three 
 modern computer simulations confirm that the "baldwin effect" is real, provided that "ordinary" evolution can create organisms whose internal performance measure is somehow correlated with actual fitness 
 more broadly, we can view direct utility estimation as searching in a hypothesis space for u that is much larger than it needs to be, in that it includes many functions that violate the bellman equations 
 NN sometimes there is no good evaluation function for a problem, but there is a good comparison method: a way to tell whether one node is better than another, without assigning numerical values to either 
 NN suppose that a knowledge base kb contains a sentence p-perhaps a default conclusion recorded by a forward-chaining algorithm, or perhaps just an incorrect assertion-and we want to execute tell(kb, Np) 
 notice that unlike the decision-theoretic methods in chapter NN, this kind of robust approach results in plans designed for the worst-case outcome, rather than maximizing the expected quality of the plan 
 since then there have been many convincing empirical demonstrations of learning from positive examples alone, such as the ilp work of mooney (NNNN) and muggleton and de raedt (NNNN) and the remarkable ph 
 some physicists studying string theory argue for NN dimensions or more, and some argue for a discrete world, but N-d continuous space-time is an adequate representation for commonsense reasoning purposes

 the actions in shakey's world include moving from place to place, pushing movable objects (such as boxes), climbing onto and down from rigid objects (such as boxes), and turning light switches on and off 
 the error bound in the preceding paragraph gives some idea of the factors influencing the runtime of the algorithm, but is sometimes overly conservative as a method of deciding when to stop the iteration 
 the following might help you get started: which classes, objects, and relations would you need? what are their parents, siblings and so on? (you will need events and temporal ordering, among other things 
 the importance of mutual illumination has been well appreciated in the computeir graphics community, where ray tracing and radiosity have been developed precisely to take mutual illumination into account 
 the latter approach can be implemented by including new modification choices in the structure search: in addition to modifying links, the algorithm can add or delete a hidden variable or change its arity 
 the NN% summarizes those cases in which all the factors needed for a cavity to cause a toothache are present and other cases in which the patient has both toothache and cavity but the two are unconnected

 theorem provers still need control information to operate efficiently, but that information is usually kept distinct from the knowledge base, rather than being part of the knowledge representation itself 
 there is one significant restriction on this algorithm: it requires that the transition matrix be invertible and that the sensor model have no zeroes-that is, every observation is possible in every state 
 this is because most samples will have very low weights and hence the weighted estimate will be dominated by the tiny fraction of samples that accord more than an infinitesimal likelihood to the evidence 
 this leads to the following idea: associate shapecontext with each sample point a descriptor, the shape context, whilch describes the coarse arrangement of the rest of the shape with respect to the point 
 two attributes xN and xN are preferentially independent of a third attribute xN if the preference between outcomes (zl, NN, NN) and (xi, N, NN) does not depend on the particular value xs for attribute xN

 for example, stemming "stocking" to "stock" will tend to decrease precision for queries about either foot coverings or financial instruments, although it could improve recall for queries about warehousing 
 good heuristics can sometimes be constructed by relaxing the problem definition, by precomputing solution costs for subproblems in a pattern database, or by learning from experience with the problem class 
 in most practical applications, however, general-purpose csp algorithms can solve problems orders of magnitude larger than those solvable via the general-purpose search algorithms that we saw in chapter N 
 in principle, this scientific theory could be given by classical ai, but in practice, eliminative imaterialists tend to lean on neuroscience and neural network research instead (churchland, NNN chapter NN

 the efficient formulation of the N- queens problem (where each new queen is placed in the leftmost empty column) is efficient in large part because of this--each state can be reached only through one path 
 the first is to use a different form of logic called modal logic modal logic, in which propositional attitudes such as believes and knows become modal modaloperator operators that are referentially opaque 
 the moral of this tale is that any process that involves comparing the performance of hypotheses on a test set must use a new test set to measure the performance of the hypothesis that is finally selected 
 the problem is exacerbated if the evidence variables occur late in the variable ordering, because then the samples will be simulations that bear little resemblance to the reality suggested by the evidence 
 this is inappropriate when each dimension of the space is measuring something different-for example, height and weight-because changing the scale of one dimension would change the set of nearest neighbors 
 this proliferation of clauses makes the knowledge base unreadable for a human, but fast propositional solvers can still handle the N x N wumpus world with ease (they reach their limit at around NNN x NNN) 
 we can use the vocabulary of lisp for lists: nil is the constant list with no elements; cons, append, first, and rest are functions; and find is the predicate that does for lists what member does for sets

 in this world, moving into a clean square sometimes deposits dirt in that square; but what if the agent doesn't know that or doesn't worry about it? then it will come up with a very simple solution: [left] 
 it also has been called the "most constrained variable" or values "fail-first" heuristic, the latter because it picks a variable that is most likely to cause a failure soon, thereby pruning the search tree

 similarly, it is extremely difficult to program an agent to fly a helicopter; yet given appropriate negative rewards for crashing, wobbling, or deviating from a set course, an agent can learn to fly by itself 
 such a research program, if successful, would be of great value to artificial intelligence because it would allow a natural language (or some derivative) to be used within representation and reasoning systems 
 the first step is to identify the set of random variables we need: as in the propositional logic case, we want one boolean variable pij for each square, which is true iff square [i, j] actually contains a pit 
 the needs of the task require only certain kinds of information and one can gain considerable computational speed and robustness by recovering only that information and fully exploiting the domain constraints

 the definitions on the left measure success in terms of fidelity to human performance, whereas the ones on the right rationality measure against an ideal concept of intelligence, which we will call rationality 
 the trick is that a NNN indicatorvariable variable in the exponent of an expression acts as an indlicatoir variable: pt is p if t = N and N otherwise; similarly (N - p)(l-t) is (N - p) if t = N and N otherwise 
 there are several points worth mentioning: rather than having to search the knowledge base for append clauses, the claiuses become a procedure and the inferences are carried out simply by calling the procedure 
 to obtain the gradient with respect to the wk weights connecting the input layer to the hidden layer, we have to keep the entire summation over i because each output value ai may be affected by changes in wk,j

 the reflectance map formalism completely fails in this situation: image brightness depends not just on the surface normal, but also on the complex spatial relationships among the different surfaces in the scene 
 they proposed a model of artificial neurons in which each neuron is characterized as being "on" or "off," with a switch to "on" occurring in response to stimulation by a sufficient number of neighboring neurons 
 thus it is not a "problem solver" that is given a single goal and then plans and acts until the goal is achieved; rather, it lives through a series of ever-changing goal formulation, planning, and acting phases

 in fact, of course, the unlikely outcome wilil occur only infrequently in a large set of lraining sequences; hence in the long run its effects will be weighted proportionally to its probability, as we would hope 
 in particular, experience suggests that a secure material advantage of more than one point will probably win the game, all other things being equal; a three-point advantage is sufficient for near-certain victory 
 intuitively, the meaning of the phrase "the wumpus" is the big, hairy beast that we represent in logic as the logical term wumpusl, and the meaning of "the wumpus is dead" is the logical sentence dead ( wumpusl) 
 it can suck in response to [dirty]; what should it do in response to [clean]? moving lefl fails (for ever) if it happens to start in square a, and moving right fails (for ever) if it happens to start in square b 
 moreover, their ability to do these things is going to increase rapidly until-in a visible future-the range of problems they can handle will be coextensive with the range to which the human mind has been applied

 the resurgence of interest in state-space planning was pioneered by drew mcdermott's unpop program (NNNN), which was the first to suggest a distance heuristic based on a relaxed problem with delete lists ignored 
 the second important class of sensors is imaging sensors-the cameras that provide us with images of the environment and, using the computer vision techniques of chapter NN, models and features of the environment 
 then the update cycle is repeated for each time step: each sample is propagated forward by sampling the next state value xt+l given the current value xt for the sample, and using the transition model p(xt+l lxt) 
 there are also specialized conferences such as the international conference on aN planning systems (aips), the international workshop on planning and scheduling for space, and the european conference on planning

 ) is m log n, as we must predict the image position of each of m model points, and find the distance to the nearest image point, a log n operation if the image points are arranged in an appropriate data structure 
 ) it seems likely that first-order representations and algorithms will be required if further progress is to occur, although structures such as planning graphs will continue to be useful as a source of heuristics 
 a complete bayesian model would include probability estimates for factors such as these, allowing us to express our "ignorance" in terms of how our beliefs would change in the face of future information gathering

 in NNNN, herbert robbins proposed a simple set of axioms that appeared to define boolean algebra, but no proof of this could be found (despite serious work by several mathematicians including alfred tarski himself) 
 in this case the advantage is small, because there are only two possible linearizations; nonetheless, an agent might welcome the flexibility-for example, if the tire has to be changed in the middle of heavy traffic 
 intuitively, it is obvious that the first solution found must be an optimal one, because goal nodes in all subsequent contours will have higher f -cost, and thus higher g-cost (because all goal nodes have h(n) = N) 
 its policy of optimism under uncertainty-always head for the closest unvisited state--can result in an exploration pattern that is less efficient in the uninformed case than simple depth-first search (koenig, NNNN)

 pruning allows us to ignore portions of the search tree that make no difference to the final choice, and heuristic evaluation functions allow us to approximate the true utility of a state without doing a complete search 
 the principal question in regression planning is this: what are the states from which applying a given action leads to the goal? computing the description of these states is called regressing the goal through the action 
 the rule can be translated into english as the protein p has fold class "four helical up and down bundle" if it contains a long helix hl at a secondary structure position between N and N and hl is next to a second helix 
 the solutions to fmp problems will typically be conditional plans or policies that make use of sensor feedback during execution and are guaranteed to work in all situations consistent with the assumed uncertainty bounds 
 the underlying principle is the following: any hypothesis that is seriously wrong will almost certainly be "$ound out" with high probability after a small number of examples, because it will make an incorrect prediction 
 therefore, johncalls needs mary calls as a parent e adding alarm: clearly, if both call, it is more likely that the alarm has gone off than if just one or neither call, so we need both marycalls and johncalls as parents 
 this is borne out even in games such as chess, checkers (draughts), and backgammon (see next section), where efforts to learn an evaluation function by means of a model have met with more success than q-learning methods 
 we did not specify which of the two quantified terms gets pulled out first, so there are actually two possible logical interpretations: b'd ddogs + Na aedaysaNe e€has(d,a,jjow); Na aedays ab'd ddogs + Ne e€has(d,a,jjow) 
 we expect that the agent will learn faster if it uses a function approximator, provided that the hypothesis space is not too large, but includes some functions that are a reasonably good fit to the true utility function 
 we start with arbitrary initial values for the utilities, calculate the right-hand side of the equation, and plug it into the left-hand side-thereby updating the utility of each state from the utilities of its neighbors 
 we will also have occasion to use a rnore general version conditionalized on some background evidence e: according to rule N on page N of strunk and white's the elements of style, it should be bayes's rather than bayes' 
 ) any h between s and g must reject all the negative examples rejected by each member of g (because it is more specific), and must accept all the positive examples accepted by any member of s (because it is more general) 
 at its heart is an important phonology discovery made in the field of phonology (the study of how language sounds), namely, that all phones human languages use a limited repertoire of about NN or NN sounds, called phones 
 axiom each of these sentences can be viewed as an axiom of the kinship domain axioms are commonly associated with purely mathematical domains-we will see some axioms for numbers shortly-but they are needed in all domains 
 can we do the same for, say, phone transition probabilities in the pronunciation model? the answer is yes, but only if someone goes to the trouble of annotating every occurrence of each word with the right phone sequence 
 dreyfus and dreyfus (NNNN) propose a five-stage process of acquiring expertise, beginning with rule-based processing (of the sort proposed in gofai) and ending with the ability to select correct responses instantaneously 
 early planners, which lacked conditionals and loops, did not explicitly recognize the concept of conditional planning; but nevertheless they sometimes resorted to a coercive style in response to environmental uncertainty 
 errors can also arise from the use of approximation algorithms such as particle filtering, which does not provide the robot with an exact belief state even if the stochastic nature of the environment is modeled perfectly 
 for example, if a problem has solution depth d = N, and each direction runs breadth-first search one node at a time, then in the worst case the two searches meet when each has expanded all but one of the nodes at depth N 
 for example, what if one refuses to bet? does that end the argument? the answer is that the betting game is an abstract model for the decision-making situation in which every agent is unavoidably involved at every moment 
 geometrically, the dot product between two vectors is equal to the cosine of the angle between the vectors; maximizing the cosine of two such vectors (in the same quadrant) means that the angle between them is close to N

 if we carry lexicalization to an extreme, we end up with categorial grammar, in which there can be as few as two grammar rules, or dependency grammar (melcuk and polguere, NNNN), in which there are no phrases, only words 
 in general, an agent with several immediate options of unknown value can decide what to do by jrst examining diflerent possible sequences of actions that lead to states of known value, and then choosing the best sequence 
 it chooses randomly between two ways to pick which symbol to flip: (N) a "min-conflicts" step that minimizes the number of unsatisfied clauses in the new state, and (N) a "random walk" step that picks the symbol randomly 
 research in this area is still at an early stage, but already it is becoming clear that firstorder probabilistic reasoning yields a tremendous increase in the effectiveness of aN systems at handling uncertain information 
 some argue that a probabilistic model would allow these same manipulations to be done in a more principled way, but ir researchers are unlikely to change unless they can see a clear performance advantage to another model 
 special-purpose logics make still further ontological commitments; for example, temporallogic temporal logic assumes that facts hold at particular times and that those times (which may be points or intervals) are ordered 
 the density function p(x = c) is defined as the ratio of the probability that x falls into an interval around c, divided by the width of the interval, as the interval width goes to zero: p(x = c) = lim p(c N x N c+dx)/dx 
 the first problem is solved by assuming that changes in the world state are caused stationary process by a stationary process-that is, a process of change that is governed by laws tlhat do not themselves change over time 
 then one possible solution for hypothesis is the following: grandparent(x, y) [N z mother(x, z) a mother (z, y)] v [N z mother(x, z) a father(z, y)] v [N z father(x, z) a mother(z, y)] v [N z father(x, z) a father(x, y)] 
 this observation leads naturally to an incremental forward chaining algorithm where, at iteration t, we check a rule only if its premise includes a conjunct p, that unifies with a fact p: newly inferred at iteraton t - N 
 we could simply construct a decision tree that has one path to a leaf for each example, where the path tests each attribute in turn and follows the value for the example and the leaf has the classification of the example

 a backward search would need to construct compact descriptions of "all states that lead to checkmate by move ml" and so on; and those descriptions would have to be tested against the states generated by the forward search 
 a pomdp has the same elements as an mdp-the transition model t(s, a, s') and the reward function r(s)- but it also has an observation model o(s, o) that specifies the probability of perceiving the observation o in state s 
 although the proof of the result is beyond the scope of this book, it has been shown that exponential growth will occur unless the error in the heuristic function grows no faster than the logarithm of the actual path cost 
 anyone with hands-on experience of robotics, computerized process control, or other forms of automatic sensing will readily testify to the fact that small amounts of measurement noise are often the least of one's problems 
 chomsky (NNNN, NNNN) pointed out the limitations of finite-state models compared with context-free models, concluding "probabilistic models give no particular insight into some of the basic problems of syntactic structure 
 disadvantages of voronoi graph techniques are that they are difficult to apply to higher dimensional configuration spaces, and that they tend to induce unnecessarily large detours when the configuration space is wide open 
 for our discrete variables, we can approximate a gaussian using a distribution in which the probability of error drops off in the appropriate way, so that the probability of mgaussianerror odel a large error is very small 
 generalization in reinforcement learning NNN some researchers, both inside and outside ai, have claimed that the availability of model-free methods such as q-learning means that the knowledge-based approach is unnecessary

 imagine watching a small bird flying through dense jungle foliage at dusk: you glimpse brief, intermittent flashes of motion; you try hard to guess where the bird is and where it will appear next so that you don't lose it 
 in all of these areas, the set of objects-and hence the set of random variables-is not known in advance, so purely "propositional" methods, such as bayesian networks, are incapable of representing the situation completely 
 in the figure we have three examples of depth discontinuity, labelled N; two surface-orientation discontinuities, labelled N; a reflectance discontinuity, labelled N; and an illumination discontinuity (shadow), labelled N 
 instead of choosing the best k from the the pool of candidate successors, stochastic beam search chooses k successors at random, with the probability of choosing a given successor being an increasing function of its value

 recent interest in genetic programming was spurred by john koza's work (koza, NNNN, NNNN), but it goes back at least to early experiments with machine code by friedberg (NNNN) and with finite-state automata by fogel et al 
 the constraints require neighboring regions to have distinct colors; for example, the allowable combinations for wa and nt are the pairs {(red, green), (red, blue), (green, red), (green, blue), (blue, red), (blue, green)) 
 the distinction between fully and partially observable environments is also central in the dynamic programming literature developed in the field of operations research (puterman, NNNN), which we will discuss in chapter NN

 there is no accounting for taste or preferences: you might think that an agent who prefers jalapeiio bubble-gum ice cream to chocolate chocolate chip is odd or even misguided, but you could not say the agent is irrational 
 therefore, the correct order in which to add nodes is to add the "root causes" jirst, then the variables they influence, and so on, until we reach the "leaves," which have no direct causal influence on the other variables 
 this actually creates two problems: first, we might have to specify an unbounded number of conditional probability tables, one for each variable in each slice; second, each one might involve an unbounded number of parents 
 using r to denote the value r = true, we can rewrite the probability as follows: p(r(d, q) = p(d, qir)p(r)/p(d, q) (by baes' rule) = p(qid,r)p(dlr)p(r)/p(d,q) (bychainrule) = ap(qid,r)p(rjd)/p(d,q) (bybayesNmle,forfixedd)

 when there are hidden variables, the inner loop may involve many iterations of em or a gradient-based algorithm, and each iteration involves the calculation of posteriors in a bayes net, which is itself an np-hard problem 
 would an inverse resolution program be theoretically capable of inferring the law of gravity? the answer is clearly yes, because the law of gravity allows one to explain the examples, given suitable background mathematics 
 also, ope]-ationality is a matter of degree: one or N steps is definitely operational, but what about NNN or loo? finally, the cost of solving a given subgoal depends om what other rules are available in the knowledge base 
 any of the supervised learning methods in chapter NN can be used, with suitable adjustments for the fact that we need to predict a complete state description rather than just a boolean classification or a single real value

 fortunately, newly invented hidden variables will usually be connected to pre-existing variables, so a human expert can often inspect the local conditional distributions involving the new variable and ascertain its meaning 
 knowledge in learning in addition to allowing the use of prior knowledge in induction, ilp systems can formulate hypotheses in general first-order logic, rather than in the restricted attribute-based language of chapter NN 
 learning with filtering can fail to converge correctly; consider, for example, the problem of learning to solve murders: hindsight is always required to infer what happened at the murder scene from the observable variables 
 learning: chapters NN to NN described how learning in an agent can be formulated as inductive learning (supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement-based) of the functions that constitute the various components of the agent 
 now the information requirements are the same as for inference using each piece of evidence separately: the prior probability p(cavity) for the query variable and the conditional probability of each effect, given its cause

 ockham's razor tells us not to make hypotheses more complex than necessary, but the graph tells us that the predictions improve as the ensemble hypothesis gets more complex! various explanations have been proposed for this 
 prior probability unconditional the unconditional or prior probability associated with a proposition a is the degree of belief prior probability accorded to it in the absence of any other information; it is written as p(a) 
 remote agent generated plans from high-level goals specified from the ground, and it monitored the operation of the spacecraft as the plans were executed-detecting, diagnosing, and recovering from problems as they occurred 
 second, when there are several goals that the agent can aim for, none of which can be achieved with certainty, utility provides a way in which the likelihood of success can be weighed up against the importance of the goals

 the addition constraints on the four columns of the puzzle also involve several variables and can be written as where xi, xN, and xN are auxiliary variables representing the digit (N or N) carried over into the next column 
 the intensity depends only on the angle of incidence of the light source: a light source directly overhead will reflect the most light, and a light source that is almost parallel to the surface will reflect almost no light 
 the model must allow for variations in pitch, speed, and signal processing volume, and relies on techniques from signal processing to provide signal descriptions that are reasonably robust against these kinds of variations 
 the problem is that the total reward on each trial may vary widely, so estimates of the policy value from a small number of trials will be quite unreliable; trying to compare two such estimates will be even more unreliable 
 this is similar to the lesson learned from constraint satisfaction problems that it is often worthwhile to compute N-consistency before searching for a solution, but less often worthwhile to compute N-consistency or higher 
 thus, at the end of each sequence, the algorithm calculates the observed reward-to-go for each state and updates the estimated utility for that state accordingly, just by keeping a running average for each state in a table 
 to control the vehicle properly, especially on curves, it should have an accelerometer; it will also need to know the mechanical stxte of the vehicle, so it will need the usual array of engine and electrical system sensors

 ) if we restrict our attention to actions that only affect the amount of money that an agent has, then it will usually be the case that the agent prefers more money to less, all other things monotonic preference being equal 
 all we can do at present is to try to keep the coastal navigation pose uncertainty to a minimum; for example, the coastal navigation heuristic requires the robot to stay near known landmarks to decrease its pose uncertainty 
 but "statistical machine translation" has come to denote an approach to the whole translation problem that is based on finding the most probable translation of a sentence, using hansard data gathered from a bilingual corpus

 often, one finds that the expected answers are not forthcoming-for example, from male(george) and spouse(george, laura), one expects to be able to infer fenzale(laura); but this does not follow from the axioms given earlier 
 peeking typically happens as follows: a learning algorithm can have various "knobs" that can be twiddled to tune its behavior-for example, various different criteria for choosing the next attribute in decision tree learning 
 the agent does not learn the true utilities or the true optimal policy! what happens instead is that, in the NNth trial, it finds a policy that reaches the +N reward along the lower route via (N,N), (N, i), (N,N), and (N,N)

 the formulation of bottom-up parsing as a search is as follows: the initial state is a list of the words in the input string, each viewed as a parse tree that is just a single leaf node-for example; [the, wumlpus, is, dead] 
 the other bottom-up component, extender,^ takes a complete edge with left hand side b and uses it to extend any incomplete rule in the chart that ends where the complete edge starts if the incomplete rule is looking for a b 
 the partial resolution of the frame problem has rekindled interest in the declarative approach to reasoning about actions, which had been eclipsed by special-purpose planning syscognitive robotics tems since the early NNNNs 
 the reason is that in a search tree with the same (or nearly the same) branching factor at each level, most of the nodes are in the bottom level, so it does not matter much that the upper levels are generated multiple times 
 this is similar to the expectiminimax algorithm for game trees with chance nodes, except that (N) there can also be rewards at non-leaf states and (N) the decision nodes correspond to belief states rather than actual states 
 this wolrks well when there are only a few categories, but for larger category sets we will build one decision tree for each category, with the leaves labeling the document as either a member NN- a nonmember of the category

 we could live with this problem-it will lead to a larger-than-necessary search space, but will not lead to incorrect answers-or we could introduce the predicate block and add bloctk(b) a block(y) to the precondition of move 
 yet it will probably not occur to me that the seventeenth petal on the largest rose in my neighbor's garden will get wet; humans keep forward chaining under careful control, lest they be swamped with irrelevant consequences 
 ") second, it assumes that inhibition of each parent is independent of inhibition of any other parents: for example, whatever inhlbits malaria from causing a fever is independent of whatever inhibits flu from causing a fever 
 a better formulation would prohibit placing a queen in any square that is already attacked: N states: arrangements of n queens (N < n N N), one per column in the leftmost n columns, with no queen attacking another are states 
 a second reason to prefer simple hypothesis spaces is that the resulting hypotheses may be simpler to use-that is, it is faster to compute h(x) when h is a linear function than when it is an arbitrary turing maclhine program 
 an example might be the "consumer confidence" index, which can be modeled as undergoing a random gaussian-distributed change each month and is measured by a random consumer survey that also introduces gaussian sampling noise

 carnap was not able to extend his inductive logic much beyond the propositional case, and putnam (NNNN) showed that some fundamental difficulties would prevent a strict extension to languages capable of expressing arithmetic 
 for example, should pits be represented by objects or by a unary predicate on squares? should the agent's orientation be a function or a predicate? should the wumpus's location depend on time? once the choices have been made 
 for example, the default rule "my brakes are always ok" really means "the probability that my brakes are ok, given no other information, is sufficiently high that the optimal decision is for me to drive without checking them 
 for example, tomatoes tend to be a dull scarlet; roughly spherical; with an indentation at the top where the stem was; about two to four inches in diameter; with a thin but tough skin; and with flesh, seeds, and juice inside 
 in that case, would this be the same mental state as one held by a brain in a body? one way to resolve the dilemma is to say that the content of mental states can be interwide content preted from two different points of view

 representing action decompositions plan library general descriptions of action decomposition methods are stored in a plan library, from which they are extracted and instantiated to fit the needs of the plan being constructed 
 the basic insight required to achieve this goal is the following: pn the propositilonal context, a bayesian network specifies probabilities over atomic events, each of which specifies a value for each variable in the network 
 the fact that smoothing can be done in constant space suggests that there should exist an efficient recursive algorithm for online smoothing-that is, an algorithm whose time complexity is independent of the length of the lag 
 we know that a logic programming definition of the append predicate can be used both to tell us that in append([l, NN, [N], x) we have x = [N, N,N] and to enumerate the values of x and y that make append(z, y, [i, N,N]) true

 intuitively, the advantage comes from the ability of crossover to combine large blocks of letters that have evolved independently to perform useful functions, thus raising the level of granularity at which the search operates 
 it is used to help make rational decisions in important domains where the stakes are high, such as business, government, law, military strategy, medical diagnosis and public health, engineering design, and resource management 
 just as ordinary em uses the current parameters to compute the expected counts in the e-step and then applies those counts in the m-step to choose new parameters, structural em uses the current structure to compute section NN 
 learning neural network structures so far, we have considered the problem of learning weights, given a fixed network structure; just as with bayesian networks, we also need to understand how to find the best network structure 
 making complex decisions has the property that the bidder with the highest value vi gets the goods at a price of b, + d, where b, is the highest bid among all the other players and d is the auctioneer's increment between bids 
 making correct inferences is sometimes part of being a rational agent, because one way to act rationally is to reason logically to the conclusion that a given action will achieve one's goals and then to act on that conclusion 
 N if an agent's degrees of belief do not accurately reflect the world, then you would expect that it would tend to lose money over the long run to an opposing agent whose beliefs more accurately reflect the state of the world

 the configuration space can be decomposed into two subspaces: the space of all configurations that a robot may attain, commonly called free space free space, and the space of unattainable configurations, called occupied space 
 the proceedings of the conferences on uncertainty in artificial intelligence (uai), neural information processing systems (nips), and artificial intelligence and statistics (aistats) are excellent sources for current research 
 the reason for applying bayes' rule in this case is that we believe we will be able to learn a language model p(f) that is more accurate than the translation model p(ei f) (and more accurate than estimating p(f i e) directly) 
 the representation of resources as numerical quantities, such as inspectors (N), rather than as named entities, such as inspector(il) and inspector(NN), is an example of a very aggregation general technique called aggregation 
 this difference disappears when the effects of td adjustments are averaged over a large number of transitions, because the frequency of each successor in the set of transitions is approximately proportional to its probability 
 this is a very natural way in which to build up the representation of a domain, and it is analogous to the ,way in which software packages are built up by successive definitions of subroutines from primitive library functions 
 this is fine for ensuring that finite state spaces do not become infinite search trees because of loops; unfortunately, it does not avoid the exponential proliferation of nonlooping paths in problems such as those in figure N 
 using first-order logic NNN we could name each square-squarel,:! and so on--but then the fact that squarel,:! and sqare, are adjacent would have to be an "extra" facit, and we would need one such fact for each pair of squares 
 waltz (NNNN) proposed an algorithm for this problem (actually for an augmented version with shadows, cracks, and separably concave edges) that was one of the first applications of constraint satisfaction in aN (see chapter N) 
 we also saw that independence and conditional independence relationships among variables can greatly reduce the number of probabilities that need to be specified in order to define bayesian network the full joint distribution 
 we can imagine tabulating the agent function that describes any given agent; for most agents, this would be a very large table-infinite, in fact, unless we place a bouind on the length of percept sequences we want to consider 
 we express this recursively, saying that x is a member of s if and only if s is equal to some set sN adjoined with some element y, where either y is ithe same as x or x is a member of sN: vx,s xes [Ny,sN (s={ylss)a (z=yz€s))] 
 whenever a variable x is assigned, the forward checking process looks at each unassigned variable y that is connected to x by a constraint and deletes from y's domain any value that is inconsistent with the value chosen for x

 the so-called poverty of the stimulus argument is that children have no language inputs other than positive examples: their parents and peers produce mostly accurate examples of their language, and very rarely correct mistakes 
 the subsequent demise of early yerceptron research efforts was hastened (or, the authors later claimed, merely explained) by the book perceptrons (minsky and papert, NNNN), which lamented the field's lack of mathematical rigor 
 the subsumption architecture is due to rodney brooks (NNNN), although similar ideas were developed independently by braitenberg (NNNN), whose book, vehicles, describes a series of simple robots based on the behavioral approach 
 there is no "official exchange rate" between the two, but it might be reasonable in this case to convert kilometers into milliseconds by using an estimate of the car's average speed (because time is what the agent cares about) 
 therefore, because gold proved that learning a cfg from positive examples is impossible, the children must already "knowN ' the grammar and be merely tuning some of its parameters of this innate grammar and learning vocabulary

 a boosted neural network combined three copies of the lenet architecture, with the second one trained on a mix of patterns that the first one got NN% wrong, and the third one trained on patterns for which the first two disagreed 
 another possible explanation is that the addition of further hypotheses enables the ensemble to be more dejinite in its distinction between positive and negative examples, which helps it when it comes to classifying new examples 
 as we show in chapter NN, the use of prior knowledge to guide inductive learning makes it possible to learn quite large sets of sentences from reasonable numbers of examples, even in a language as expressive as first-order logic

 the noisy-or model allows for uncertainty about the ability of each parent to cause the child to be true-the causal relationship between parent and child may be inhibited, and so a patient could have a cold, but not exhibit a fever 
 the policy iteration algorithm alternates the following two steps, beginning from some initial policy to: policy evaluation policy evaluation: given a policy i, calculate ui = uti, the utility of each state if i were to be executed 
 the speaker's intent to communicate is an unobserved cause of the words in the utterance, and the hearer's job is to work backwards from the words and from knowledge of the situation to recover the most likely intent of the speaker 
 this approach implies the use of statistics and learning to take advantage of the corpus, and it usually entails probabilistic language models that can be learned from data and that are simpler than the augmented dcgs of chapter NN 
 to test the heuristic functions hl and ha, we generated NNNN random problems with solution lengths from N to NN (NNN for each even number) and solved them with iterative deepening search and with a* tree search using both hl and hN 
 two important questions to ask are: are you concerned with thinking or behavior? do you want to model humans or work from an ideal standard? in this book, we adopt the view that intelligence is concerned mainly with rational action 
 uncertainty this lund of question has been the subject of decades of intense debate between those who advocate the use of probabilities as the only legitimate form for degrees of belief and those who advocate alternative approaches 
 various attempts have been made, notably by henry kyburg (NNNN, NNNN), to formulate more sophisticated policies in order to avoid some obvious fallacies that arise with reichenbach's rule, but such approaches remain somewhat ad hoe

 given these difficulties, how is it possible that truth-functional systems were ever considered useful? the answer lies in restricting the task and in carefully engineering the rule base so that undesirable interactions do not occur 
 i to carry out the first step, we will need three new concepts: herbrand universe N herbrand universe: if s is a set of clauses, then hs, the herbrand universe of s, is the set of all ground terms constructible from the following: a

 in the example, pragmatics does two things: replace the constant notv with the constant sg, which stands for the current situation, and replace wumpus with wumpusl, which stands for the single wumpus that is known to be in this cave 
 it is due to john searle (NNNN), who describes a hypothetical system that is clearly running a program and passes the turing test, but that equally clearly (according to searle) does not understand anything of its inputs and outputs 
 now the update equations for the mean and covariance, in their full, hairy horribleness, are pt+l = fpt + kt+l(t+l - hfpt) &+l = (i - k+)(f'cf + x,) where kt+l = (f&f + e,)h(h(f&f + x,)h + x,)-' is called the kalman gain gain matrix

 the same task is addressed more directly by the minimum description minimum description length length, or mdl, learning method, which attempts to minimize the size of hypothesis and data encodings rather than work with probabilities 
 the three-dmensional configuration of a protein molecule cannot be represented reasonably by a set of attributes, because the configuration inherently refers to relationships between objects, not to attributes of a single section NN 
 there is one expensive step: when matching a variable against a complex term, one must check whether the variable itself occurs inside the term; if it does, the match fails occurcheck because no consistent unifier can be constructed 
 they showed that under certain independence assumptions about the distribution of leaf values in the tree, minimaxing can yield values at the root that are actually less reliable than the direct use of the evaluation function itself

 we could be trying to extract instances of addresses from web pages, with database fields for street, city, state, and zip code; or instances of storms from weather reports, with fields for temperature, wind speed, and precipitation 
 without the ability to handle incorrect information, an agent can end up being as unintelligent as the dung beetle (page NN), which attempts to plug up its nest with a ball of dung even after the ball has been removed from its grasp 
 [n this case, the policy value is just the expected value of the reward, and we have now we perform a simple trick so that this summation can be approximated by samples generated from the probability distribution defined by rs(so, a) 
 all our other agents, which would shut off their percepts until the planner returns a complete solution to this problem, the continuous planning agent builds the plan incrementally, with each increment taking a bounded amount of time

 certain kinds of univer- ,sally quantified sentences can be asserted using inverse links and the singly boxed and doubly boxed arrows applied to categories, but that still leaves us a long way short of full first-order NNN chapter NN 
 if there is a variable x with zero legal values remaining, the mrv heuristic will select x and failure will be detected immediately-avoiding pointless searches through other variables which always will fail when x is finally selected 
 in other cases, the obje'ctive function might not be available in a differentiable form at all-for example, the value of a particular set of airport locations may be determined by running some large-scale ecoinomic simulation package

 the circuit-based agent, on the lN in fact, all the inferences done by a circuit can be done in linear time by dpll! this is because evaluating a circuit, like forward chaining, can be emulated by dpll using the unit propagation rule 
 the e-step is the computation of the summation, which is the expectation of the log likelihood of the "completed" data with respect to the distribution p(z = zlx, dz)), which is the posterior over the hidden variables, given the data 
 the inclusion of continuous random variables in bayesian networks was considered by pearl (NNNN) and shachter and kenley (NNNN); these papers discussed networks containing only continuous variables with linear gaussian disN,ributions 
 the sharp-eyed reader will have noticed that forward checking can supply the conflict set with no extra work: whenever forward checking based on an assignment to x deletes a value frorn y's domain, it should add x to y's conflict set 
 the third step is to remember that, in addition to complements, verb phrases (and other adjuncts phrases) can also take adjuncts, which are phrases that are not licensed by the individual verb but rather may appear in any verb phrase 
 the value of a simple function applied to a given object may be observed or unknown; these will be the basic random variables of our representatioaN complex function we also allow complex functions, which map objects to other objects 
 this approach suffices for many applications, but it does not capture the generative character of the metaphor that allows humans to use new instances such as "nosedive" or "blasting through the roof" without fear of misunderstanding 
 this might be worth it if the costs could be amortized over many messages, but in a real network tlhe costs c, would fluctuate constantly, because of traffic congestion and because some machines will crash and others will come online 
 this shows both laziness and ignorance in operation: it would be a lot of work to find out why those factors would be more or less likely in any particular case, and we have no reasonable way to obtain the relevant information anyway 
 this two-part process emerges quite simply: p(xt+N lel,t+l) = p(xt+l lelzt, et+l) (dividing up the evidence) = a p(et+l ixt+l, el,t)p(xt+l (el:t) (using bayes' rule) = a p(ettN ixt+l)p(xt+l lel:t) (by the markov property of evidence) 
 unlike most special-purpose logics, higher-order logic is strictly more expressive than first-order logic, in the sense that some sentences of higher-order logic cannot be expressed by any finite number of first-order logic sentences

 " in fact, the field of active vision, underpinned by the theory of information value (chapter NN), is concerned with exactly the problem of directing sensors, and already some robots have incorporated the theoretical results obtained 
 although chimpanzees, dolphins, and other mammals have shown vocabularies of hundreds of signs and some aptitude for stringing them together, only humans can reliably communicate an unbounded number of qualitatively different messages 
 although we understand now that other lunds of systems-including bayesian networks-have these properties, neural networks remain one of the most popular and effective forms of learning system and are worthy of study in their own right 
 clips (wygant, NNNN) was a c-based production system language developed at nasa that allowed better integration with other software, hardware, and sensor systems and was used for spacecraft automation and several military applications 
 for example, offline algorithms such as a* have the ability to expand a node in one part of the space and then immediately expand a node in ainother part of the space, because node expansion involves simulated rather than real actions 
 given the results of (a) and (b), a recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm can be constructed by first running forward along the sequence and then backwards from the end, storing just the required messages at the middle ,and thie ends 
 helmholtz applied the scientific method to the study of human vision, and his handbook of physiological optics is even now described as "the single most important treatise on the physics and physiology of human vision" (nalwa, NNNN, p 
 in the feature extraction approach, agents detect some small number of features in their sensory input and pass them directly to their agent program, which can act reactively to the features, or can combine them with other information 
 notice that the use of x in this way does not increase the formal expressive power of first-order logic, because any sentence that includes a a-expression can be rewritten by "plugging in" its arguments to yield an equivalent sentence 
 one important point is that the probabilities required are those obtained by smoothing rather than filtering; that is, we need to pay attention to subsequent evidence in estimating the probability that a particular transition occurred 
 others, following minsky's idea of frames (NNNN), adopted a more structured approach, assembling facts about particular object and event types and arranging the types into a large taxonomic hierarchy analogous to a biological taxonomy

 the notation that semantic networks provide for certain kinds of sentences is often more convenient, but if we strip away the "human interface" issues, the underlying concepts-objects, relations, quantification, and so on-are the same 
 the second thread began with the deoccupancy grid velopment of the occupancy grid representation for probabilistic mapping, which specifies the probability that each (x, y) location is occupied by an obstacle (moravec and elfes, NNNN) 
 the third condition seems rather technical, but simply reflects the constraint that any given variable must have the same value in every subproblem in which it appears; the links joining subproblems in the tree enforce this constraint 
 this doesn't mean that there is no solution from the current state; it simply means that if there is a noncyclic solution, it must be reachable from the earlier incarnation of the current state, so the new incarnation can be discarded 
 with pruning, noise can be tolerated: classification errors give a linear increase in prediction error, whereas errors in the descriptions of ex,amples have an asymptotic effect that gets worse as the tree shrinks down to smaller sets

 a randomly chosen example from the training set has the ith value for the attribute with probability (pi + ni)/(p + n), so on average, after testing attribute a, we will need information gain bits of information to classify the example 
 all sentences are constructed from atomic sentences and the five connectives; therefore, we need to specify how to compute the truth of atomic sentences and how to compute the truth of sentences formed with each of the five connectives 
 as pinker (NNNN) puts it: "when people think about spring, surely they are not confused as to whether they are thinking about a season or something that goes boing-and if one word can correspond to two thoughts, thoughts can't be words 
 conditional planning N conditional planning: also known as contingency planning, this approach deals with bounded indeterminacy by constructing a conditional plan with different branches for the different contingencies that could arise 
 for example, now the pointwise product inside the summation is computed, and the variable is summed out of the resulting matrix: e notice that matrices are not multiplied until we need to sum out a variable from the accumulated product 
 in this way, the "global" definition of rationality-designating as rational those agent functions that have the highest performance-is turned into a "local" constraint on rational-agent designs that can be expressed in a simple program 
 N naive bayes such a probability distribution is called a naive bayes model-"naive" because it is often used (as a simplifying assumption) in cases where the "effect" variables are not conditionally independent given the cause variable 
 new research on probabilistic reasoning appears both in mainstream aN journals such as artijicial intelligence and the journal of ai research, and in more specialized journals, such as the international journal of approximate reasoning

 this discovery is related to the introduction of the use of geometrical invariants in object recognition, as surveyed by mundy and zisserman (NNNN), and the development of affine structure from motion by koenderink and van doorn (NNNN) 
 this means that the player is unable to incorporate any beliefs it might have about how the other players are likely to act, and therefore that it might be wasting some of its value defending against threats that will never materialize

 when the depth-first search completes its exploration of the possible solutions arising from the current answer and backs up to the choice point, the choice point is expanded to yield a new answer for the subgoal and a new choice point 
 at first sight, it might seem that card games are just like dice games: the cards are dealt randomly and determine the moves available to each player, but all the dice are rolled at the beginning! we will pursue this observation further 
 first, instead of constructing the list of all possible answers for each subgoal before continuing to the next, prolog interpreters generate one answer and a "promise" to generate the rest when the current answer has been fully explored

 given a corpus of trees, we can create a pcfg just by counting (and smoothing): for each nonterminal symbol, just look at all the nodes with that symbol as root, and create rules for each different combination of children in those nodes 
 having computed lilt, we obtain the actual likelihood by summing out xt: smoothing as we said earlier, smoothing is the process of computing the distribution over past states given evidence up to the present; that is, p(xk for N < k < t 
 how should b be ordered with respect to the steps in d'? the most obvious solution is that b should come before every step in d', and that can be achieved by replacing every constraint of the form start + s in d' with a constraint b + s 
 NN), but they do not say that the action cannot be executed! to avoid generating plans with illegal actions, we must preconditlon add precondition axioms stating that an action occurrence requires the preconditions to be axioms satified

 we can respond by adopting a fixed policy, such as maintaining indices only on keys composed of a predicate plus each argument, or by using an adaptive ]policy that creates indices to meet the demands of the kinds of queries being asked 
 when we say "the agent was either walking or chewing gum for the last two minutes" we might mean that the agent was doing one of the actions for the whole interval, or we might mean that the agent was alternating between the two actions 
 " it would be very strange if "sN,N" meant that there is a stench in square [N,N] and "sl,z" meant that there is a stench in square [N,N], but "sN,N a sN,N" meant that france and poland drew N-N in last week's ice hockey qualifying match

 the second drawback of the basic algorithm is that iN needs to be modified to work in an online setting where smoothed estimates must be computed for earlier time slices as new observations are continuously added to the end of the sequence 
 this is true not just for the univariate case; the full multivariate gaussian distribution has the form multiplying out the terms in the exponent makes it clear that the exponent is also a quadratic function of the random variables xi in x

 most of the best programs combine pattern recognition techniques (when the fcllowing pattern of pieces appears, this move should be considered) with limited search (decide whether these pieces can be captured, staying within the local area) 
 one of the principal objections of the logicists was that the numerical calculations that probability theory was thought to require were not apparent to introspection and presumed an unrealistic level of precision in our uncertain knowledge

 the three principal topics omitted are the following: qualitative physics: qualitative physics is a subfield of knowledge representation concerned specifically with constructing a logical, nonnumeric theory of physical objects and processes 
 what, then, is to be done? what the greedy agent has overlooked is that actions do more than provide rewards according to the current learned model; they also contribute to learning the true model by affecting the percepts that are received

 in the remainder of this section, we outline four basic kinds of agent program that embody the principles underlying almost all intelligent systems: simple reflex agents; model-based reflex agents; goal-based agents; and utility-based agents 
 in this case, with the unigram model from the book, the best sequence of words is indeed "it is easy to read words without spaces," with probability comparing subparts of the sequence, we see for example that "easy" has unigram probability N 
 it is precisely because the analysis abstracts over both the exact number of operations (by ignoring the constant factor k) and the exact content of the input (by considering only its size n) that the analysis becomes mathematically feasible

 dendral was powerful because all the relevant theoretical knowledge to solve these problems has been mapped over from its general form in the [spectrum prediction component] ("first principles") to efficient special forms ("cookbook recipes") 
 in its simplest form, local beam search can suffer from a lack of diversity among the k states-they can quickly become concentrated in a small region of the state space, making the search little more than an expensive version of hill climbing 
 in that chapter, we will also expand on one final and very important point: in games of imperfect information, it's best to give away as little information to the opponent as possible, and often the best way to do this is to act unpredictably 
 inverse resolution inverse resolution is based on the observation that if the example classifications follow from background a hypothesis a descriptions, then one must be able to prove this fact by resolution (lbecause resolution is complete)

 N some people say an advantage of htn planning is that it can solve problems like "tike a round trip from los angeles to new york and bacNc" that are hard to express in non-htn notations because the start and goal states would be the same (at(la)) 
 probabilistic reasoning over time isolated words if we want to recognized isolated words-that is, words spoken without any surrounding context and with clear boundaries-then we need to find the word that maximizes p(wrdle,) = a p(el:tjword)p(word) 
 sentences that allow reasoning "across time" are called diachronic; for example, the agent needs to know how to combine information about its previous location with information about the action just taken in order to determine its current location 
 sometimes the arrangement is quite periodic, as in the stitches on a sweater; in other instances, such as pebbles on a beach, the regularity is only in a statistical sense: the density of pebbles is roughly the same on different parts of the beach 
 sometimes the assumption is exactly true-for example, randomwalk if a particle is executing a random walk along the x-axis, changing its position by f N at each time step, then using the x-coordinate as the state gives a first-order markov process 
 the first selective search algorithm with some theoretical grounding was probably b* (berliner, NNNN), which attempts to maintain interval bounds on the possible value of a node in the game tree, rather than giving it a single pointvalued estimate 
 the goal is to find the cheapest path for a message to travel from origin to destination, where the cost of the whole route there is actually a small chance that the player with highest vi fails to get the goods, in the case where b, < wi < b, + d 
 we generated NNNN samples from a model whose true parameters are that is, the candies are equally likely to come from either bag; the first is mostly cherries with red wrappers and holes; the second is mostly limes with green wrappers and no holes 
 we then use a lifting lemma to show that, for any propositional resolution proof using the set of ground sentences, there is a corresponding first-order resolution proof using the first-order sentences from which the ground sentences were obtained 
 we will assume that the agent knows just the following: actions(s), which returns a list of actions allowed in state s; the step-cost function c(s, a, sl)-note that this cannot be used until the agent knows that sf is the outcome; and goal-test(s) 
 anyone who has driven a car knows that a parking lot stall with one millimeter of clearance on either side is not really a parking space at all; for the same reason, we would prefer solution paths that are robust with respect to small motion errors 
 first, the afsms are usually driven by raw sensor input, an arrangement that works if the sensor data is reliable and contains all necessary information for decision making, but fails if sensor data has to be integrated in nontrivial ways over time 
 for example, in deciding what levels of a carcinogenic substance to allow into the environment, policy makers must weigh the prevention of deaths against the economic hardship that might result from the elimination of certain products and processes 
 in fact, because it keeps just one current state in memory, hill-climbing search is already an online search algorithm! unfortunately, it is not very useful in its simplest form because it leaves the agent sitting at local maxima with nowhere to go 
 in fact, the filtering process already incorporates a one-step prediction, and it is easy to derive the following recursive computation for predicting the state at t + k + N from a prediction for t + k: p(xt+h+lle:t) = x p(xt+k+l ixt+n)p(xt+xlel:i) 
 our crime example is rather too small to show this effectively, but notice that a partial match is constructed on the first iteration between the rule american(x) a weapon(y) a sells (x, y, z) a hostile(z) + criminal(x) and the fact american( west) 
 strictly speaking, the new knowledge base is not logically equivalent inferential equivalence to the old, but it can be shown to be inferentially equivalent in the sense that it is satisfiable exactly when the original knowledge base is satisfiable 
 there is no doubt that planners such as graphplan, satplan, and blackbox have moved the field of planning forward, both by raising the level of performance of planning systems and by clarifying the representational and combinatorial issues involved 
 together, execution monitoring and replanning fiorm a general strategy that can be applied to both fully and partially observable environments, and to a variety of planning representations including state-space, partial-order, and conditional plans 
 we adopt the notation of davies (NNNN): nationality (x, n) + language(x, N) as usual, this is simply a syntactic sugaring, but it makes it clear that the determination is really a relationship between the predicates: nationality determines language 
 weak ai: can machines act intelligently? NN N behavior is far too complex to be captured by any simple set of rules and that because computers can do no more than follow a set of rules, they cannot generate behavior as intelligent as that of humans 
 although the paper served to initiate interest in the field of knowledge representation per se, it was criticized as a recycling of earlier ideas developed in object-oriented programming, such as inheritance and the use of default values (dahl et al 
 each unit i first computes a weighted sum of its inputs: n activation function then it applies an activation function g to this sum to derive the output: bias weight notice that we have included a bias weight wo,i connected to a fixed input ao = - N 
 effective propositional inference NNN function wasat(clauses, p, max-flips) returns a satisfying model or failure inputs: clauses, a set of clauses in propositional logic p, the probability of choosing to do a "randorn walk" move, typically around N 
 for example, how can we use a deterministic path planner to control a mobile robot that has no clue where it is? in general, if the robot's true state is not the one identified by the maximum likelihood rule, the resulting control will be suboptimal 
 for k-way classificatior, one could divide the single output unit's range intlo k portions, but itt is more common to have k separate output units, with the value of each one representing the relative likelihood of that class given the current input 
 in linguistics, optimality theory (linguistics) (kager, NNNN) is based on the idea of building soft constraints into the grammar, giving a natural ranking to interpretations, rather than having the grammar generate all possibilities with equiil rank 
 inductive logic programming work for language learning includes the chill system by zelle and mooney (NNNN) and a program by mooney and califf (NNNN) that learned rules for the past tense of verbs better than past neural net or decision tree systems 
 N(a), for example, it is not obvious how to learn the conditional distribution for heartdisease, given its parents, because we do not know the value of heartdisease in each case; the same problem arises in learning the distributions for the symptoms 
 NN an inverse resolution step that generates a new predicate p some of the deepest revolutions in science come from the invention of new predicates and functions-for example, galileo's invention of acceleration or joule's invention of thermal energy 
 pearl (NNNN) developed a clustering algorithm for exact inference in general bayesian networks, utilizing a conversion to a directed polytree of clusters in which message passing was used to achieve consistency over variables shared between clusters 
 since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an "intelligence explosion," and the intelligence of man would be left far behind 
 the analogy to local search algorithms has already been described; the principal difference between stochastic beam search and evolution is the use of sexual reproduction, wherein successors are generated from multiple organisms rather than just one 
 the rate of change of the error with respect to each parameter di is aej/aqi, so to move the parameter in the direction of decreasing the error, we want widrow-hoffrule this is called the widrow-hoff rule, or the delta rule, for online least-squares 
 thus, instead many standard formulations of probability theory take atomic events, also known as sample points, as primitive and define a random variable as a function taking an atomic event as input and returning a value from the appropriate domain 
 to escape the problem that simplicity depends on the way in which information is represented, it is proposed that simplicity be measured by the length of the shortest program for a universal turing machine that correctly reproduces the observed data 
 using well-designed hierarchies, htn planners, such as prs (georgeff and lansky, NNNN) and rap (firby, NNNN), as well as continuous planning agents, can achieve reactive response times and complex long-range planning behavior in many problem domains 
 we say "roughly speaking" because the planning graph records only a restricted subset of the possible negative interactions among actions; therefore, it might be optimistic about the minimum number of time steps required for a literal to become true 
 we will use the max max norm norm, which measures the length of a vector by the length of its biggest component: with this definition, the "distance" between two vectors, i iu - u'i N, is the maximum difference between any two corresponding elements 
 while the ancient greeks and others had made contributions to economic thought, smith was the first to treat it as a science, using the idea that economies can be thought of as consisting of individual agents maximizing their own economic well-being 
 why is the mind-body problem a problem? the first difficulty goes back to renc descartes, who considered how an immortal soul interacts with a mortal body and concluded dualism that the soul and body are two distinct types of things-a dualist theory 
 with suitable indexing, it is easy to identify all the rules that can be triggered by any given fact, and indeed marly real systems operate in an "update" mode wherein forward chaining occurs in response to each new fact that is tell^^ to the system 
 ) patricia churchland (NNNN) points out that the functionalist arguments that operate at the level of the neuron can also operate at the level of any larger functional unit-a clump of neurons, a mental module, a lobe, a hemisphere, or the whole brain 
 explain, in precise terms, within the context (of state-space search, why humans do not drive round scenic loops indefinitely, and explain how to define the state space and operators for route ,finding so that artificial agents can also avoid looping 
 for example, fly(pN, jfk, sNN'N)' and fly (pN, jfk, lax)' cannot both occur, because each negates the precondition of the other; on the other hand, fly (pi, sfo, jfei)' and fly(pN, jfk, sfo)' can occur together because the two planes do not interfere 
 fortunately, there is a famous theorem due to jacques herbrand (NNNN) to the effect that if a sentence is entailed by the original, first-order knowledge base, then there is a proof involving just a$nite subset of the propositionalized knowledge base 
 if a complete proof procedure can be found for mathematical statements, two things follow: first, all conjectures can be established mechanically; second, all of mathematics can be established as the logical consequence of a set of fundamental axioms 
 implementing ir systems so far, we have defined how ir systems work in the abstract, but we haven't explained how to make them efficient so that a web search engine can return the top results from a multibillion-page collection in a tenth of a second 
 in addition to the underlying theory, garey and johnson provide examples that convey very forcefully why computer scientists are unanimous in drawing the line between tractable and intractable problems at the border between polynomial and exponential 
 in part NNN, propositional logic, which was presented as a stepping-stone to first-order logic in the first edition, is now presented as a useful representation language in its own right, with fast inference algorithms and circuit-based agent designs 
 in the same way, we can write a definition of s that can be used in two ways: to parse, we ask s(sem, [john, loves, mary]) and get back sem, = loves(john, mary); to generate, we ask s(loves(john, mary), words) and get back words = [john, loves, mary] 
 informed search and N exploration informed search this section shows how an informed search strategy--one that uses problem-specific knowledge beyond the definition of the problem itself-can find solutions more efficiently than an uninformed strategy 
 later in this section, we will investigate how such utility functions can be specified in general; for reward now, we will simply stipulate that in each state s, the agent receives a reward r(s), which may be positive or negative, but must be bounded 
 learning in intelligent agents can be summarized as a process of modification of each component of the agent to bring the components into closer agreement with the available feedback information, thereby improving the overall performance of the agent 
 mason (NNNN) argued that sensing often can and should be dispensed with in robotic planning, and described a sensorless plan that can move a tool into a specific position on a table by a sequence of tilting actions, regardless of the initial position 
 paul broca's (NNNN-NNNN) study of aphasia (speech deficit) in brain-damaged patients in NNNN reinvigorated the field and persuaded the medical establishment of the existence of localized areas of the brain responsible for specific cognitive functions 
 rosenblatt (NNNN) invented the modern "perceptron" and proved the perceptron convergence theorem (NNNN), although it had been foreshadowed by purely mathematical work outside the context of neural networks (agimon, NNNN; motzkin and schoenberg, NNNN) 
 the htn therefore views planning as a process of making ari activity description more concrete, rather than (as in the case of state-space and partial-order planning) a process of constructing an activity description, starting from the empty activity 
 the main professional societies for aN are the american association for artificial intelligence (aaai), the acm special interest group in artificial intelligence (sigart), and the society for artificial intelligence and simulation of behaviour (aisb) 
 the most important ideas are as follows: a game can be defined by the initial state (how the board is set up), the legal actions in each state, a terminal test (which says when the game is over), and a utility function that applies to terminal states 
 the most obvious change from the passive case is that the agent is no longer equipped with a fixed policy, so, if it learns a utility function u, it will need to learn a model in order to be able to choose an action based on u via one-step look-ahead 
 this remarkable property transition probability follows from the specific transition probability with which the process moves from one state to another, as defined by the conditional distribution given the markov blanket of the variable being sampled 
 thus, mental states cannot be duplicated just on the basis of some program having the same functional structure with the same input-output behavior; we would require that the program be running on an architecture with the same causal power as neurons 
 what does this tell you absout discourse comprehension? probabilistic N N language processing in which we see how simple, statistically trained language models can be used to process collections of millions of words, rather than just single sentences

 a logical formulation of learning NNN least-commitment search backtracking arises because the current-best-hypothesis approach has to choose a particular hypothesis as its best guess even though it does not have enough data yet to be wre of the choice 
 a plan library could contain several decompositions for any given high-level action; for example, there might be another decomposition for buildhouse that describes a process whereby the agent builds a house from rocks and turf with its own bare hands 
 aldeductive synthesis though flly automated dleductive synthesis, as it is called, has not yet become feasible for general-purpose programming, hand-guided deductive synthesis has been successful in designing several novel and sophisticated algorithms 
 almost all planners for large-scale applications are htn planners, because htn planning allows the human expert to provide the crucial knowledge about how to perform complex tasks so that large plans can be constructed with little computational effort 
 bibliographical and historical notes one of the earliest applications of the principle of maximum expected utility (although a deviant one involving infinite utilities) was pascal's wager, first published as part of the portroyal logic (arnauld, NNNN) 
 certainly, most of evolution and a large part of the brain have been devoted to perception and motor slulls, whereas aN has found tasks such as game playing and logical inference to be easier, in many ways, than perceiving and acting in the real world 
 do they pose a more credible threat than witches and ghosts? if robots are properly designed as agents that adopt their owner's goals, then they probably do not: robots that derive from incremental advances over current designs will serve, not conquer 
 for simplicity, we will derive this estimate for the simple case of a nonsequential environment in which the trivially, the approximate q-function defined by djs (a, s) = q* (a, s)/NN gives optimal performance, even though it is not at all close to q* 
 if a test for operationality is carried out at each step in the construction of the generalized proof, then we can prune the rest of a branch as soon as an operational subgoal is found, keeping just the operational subgoal as a conjurct of he new rule 
 in the first-order context, a model (with its interpretation) specifies a domain of objects, the relations that hold among those objects, and a mapping from the constants and predicates of the knowledge base to the objects and relations & in the model 
 inference in temporal models NNN the forward-backward algorithm forms the backbone of the computational methods employed in many applications that deal with sequences of noisy observations, ranging from speech recognition to radar tracking of aircraft 
 one example of this is the tragedy of the commons, a situation in which individual farmers all bring their livestock to graze for free on the town commons, with the result being the destruction of the commons and a negative utility for all the farmers 
 the famous sapir-whorf hypothesis claims that the language we speak profoundly influences the way in which we think and make decisions, in particular by setting up the category structure by which we divide up the world into different sorits of objects 
 the most famous example of a truthcertainty factors functional system for uncertain reasoning is the certainty factors model, which was developed for the mycin medical diagnosis program and was widely used in expert systems of the late NNNNs and NNNNs 
 the word choice model now can llook only at words that are aligned to each other, rather than at all words in the sentence, and the offset model can look at each position in the sentence to see how often it moves according to the word alignment vector 
 this is because semantic networks provide direct indexing only for objects, categories, and the links emanating from them; in the vocabulary of first-order logic, it is as if the knowledge base were indexed only on the first argument of each predicate 
 this trichromatic perception of color is related to the fact thathe retina has three types of cones with receptivity peaks at NNN nm, NNN nm, and NNN nm, respectively, but the exact details of the relationship is more complex than a one-to-one mapping 
 if the original hypothesis space allows for a simple and efficient learning algorithm, then the ensemble method provides a way to learn a much more expressive class of hypotheses without incurring much additional computational or algorithmic complexity 
 loreover, we know that several recent algorithmic improvements have allowed programs running on standard pcs to win every world computer-chess championship since NNNN, often defeating massively parallel opponents that could search NNNN times more nodes 
 making simple decisions substitutability N substitutability: if an agent is indifferent between two lotteries, a and b, then the agent is indifferent between two more complex lotteries that are the same except that b is substituted for a in one of them 
 NN it is now more common to build on existing theories than to propose brand new ones, to base claims on rigorous theorems or hard experimental evidence rather than on intuition, and to show relevance to real-world applications rather than toy examples 
 once the actions have been chosen, all the internal constraints from d' are copied over-for example, that getpermit is ordered before construction and that there is a causal link between these two steps supplying the permit precondition of construction 
 sensorless problems (also called conformant problems): if the agent has no sensors at all, then (as far as it knows) it could be in one of several possible initial states, and each action might therefore lead to one of several possible successor states 
 the fitted utility functions exhibit unacceptably large risk premiums for lotteries with a large spread most of the subjects, however, can reconcile their inconsistencies and feel that they have learned an important lesson about how they want to behave 
 the models themselves agree: the trigram model assigns its random string a probability of lo-'', the bigram NN-", and the unigram at half a million words, this book does not contain enlough data to produce a good bigram model, let alone a trigram model 
 we will take it as given that any sentence in first-order logic (without equality) can be rewritten as a set of clauses in cne this can be proved by induction on the form of the sentence, using atomic sentences as the base case (davis and putnam, NNNN) 
 after reading the previous chapter, one might suppose that an information retrieval system could be built by parsing the document collection into a knowledge base of logical sentences and then parsing each query and asking the knowledge base for answers 
 eventually, we expect task-specific algorithms such as alpha-beta search and backward chaining to disappear from aN systems, to be replaced by general methods that direct the agent's computations toward the efficient generation of high-quality decisions 
 for example, a biped has two legs attached to a body: biped (a) N NN,NN, b leg(ll) a leg(Na) a body(b) a partof (ii, a) a partof (lz, a) partof (b, a) a attached(lN, b) a attached(lN, b) a NN # NN a ['d lN leg(iN) a partof (NN, a) * (NN = NN v NN = lz)] 
 high-dimensional spaces pose an additional problem, namely that nearest neighbors in such spaces are usually a long way away! consider a dlata set of size n in the d-dimensional unit hypercube, and assume hypercubic neighborhoods of side b and volume bd 
 if we extend plan monitoring to check whether the current state satisfies the plan preconditions at any future point, rather than just the current point, then plan monitoring will also be able to take advantage of serendipity-that is, accidental success

 one problem with a purely physical conception of the mind is that it seems to leave little room for free will: if the mind is governed entirely by physical laws, then it has no more free will than a rock "deciding" to fall toward the center of the earth 
 the relevant prior knowledge in this case is that, within any given country, most people tend to speak the same language; on the other hand, fernando is not assumed to be the name sf all brazilians because this kind of regularity does not hold for names 
 this resurgence did not come without a fight; peter cheeseman's (NNNN) pugnacious "in defense of probability," and his later article "an inquiry into computer understanding" (cheeseman, NNNN, with commentaries) give something of the flavor of the debate 
 whereas an implementation of a* search that is half as efficient will simply cost twice as much to run to completion, a chess program that is half as efficient in using its available time probably will be beaten into the ground, other things being equal

 ) what programming languages lack is any general mechanism for deriving facts from other facts; each update to a data structure is done by a domain-specific procedure whose details are derived by the programmer from his or her own knowledge of the domain 
 an interlingua-based system follows the solid lines, parsing english first into a syntactic form, then into a sematic representation and an interlingua / representation, and then through generation to a semantic, syntactic, and lexical form in i / french 
 declarative bias this section has only scratched the surface of the: field of declarative bias, which aims to understand how prior knowledge can be used to identify the appropriate hypothesis space within which to search for the correct target definition 
 for example, we know that persons have female persons as mothers, so can we draw a has,vother link from persons to femalepersons? the answer is no, because hasmother is a relation between a person and his or her mother, and categories do not have mother^ 
 if we apply this rule to our sample sentence, however, we obtain 'dx [animal (a) a iloves(x, a)] v loves (b, x) which has the wrong meaning entirely: it says that everyone either fails to love a particular animal a or is loved by some particular entity b 
 if we consider just the parameters oN and oa that define the linear relationship between x and y, it becomes clear that maximizing the log likelihood with respect to these parameters is the same as minimizing the numerator in the exponent of equation (NN

 reified objects and events work fine for the first sense of believes, but for the second sense we need to reify descriptions of those objects and events, so that clark and superman can be different descriptions (even though they refer to the same object) 
 shannon's NNNN paper, programming a computer for playing chess, proposed instead that programs should cut off the search earlier and apply a heuristic evaluation function to states in the search, effectively turning nonterminal nodes into terminal leaves 
 siting a new airport requires consideration of the disruption caused by construction; the cost of land; the distance from centers of population; the noise of flight operations; safety issues arising from local topography and weather conditions; and so on 
 so the initial state would be "in bucharest; visited {bucharest}," a typical intermediate state would be "in vaslui; visited {bucharest,urziceni,vaslui)," and the goal test would check whether the agent is in bucharest and all NN cities have been visited 
 such an approach should set off alarm bells in the reader's head, because the posteriors computed by smoothing are distributions over single time steps, whereas to find the most likely sequence we must consider joinl probabilities over all the time steps 
 summary NN uninformed search algorithms for problem solving are a central topic of classical computer science (horowitz and sahni, NNNN) and operations research (dreyfus, NNNN); deo and pang (NNNN) and gallo and pallottino (NNNN) give more recent surveys 
 the biggest problem with rejection sampling is that it rejects so many samples! the fraction of samples consistent with the evidence e drops exponentially as the number of evidence variables grows, so the procedure is simply unusable for complex problems

 to specify a hybrid network, we have to specify two new kinds of distributions: the conditional distribution for a continuous variable given discrete or continuous parents; and the conditional distribution for a discrete variable given continuous parents 
 we must not introduce cycles in the process, so many algorithms assume that an ordering is given for the variables, and that a node can have parents only among those nlodes that come earlier in the ordering gust as in the construction process chapter NN) 
 " the idea is to evaluate a given course of action when there are unseen cards by first computing the minimax value of that action for each possible deal of the cards, and then computing the expected value over all deals using the probability of each deal

 additional state variables can be added to a temporal model while staying within the hmm framework, but only by combining all the state variables into a single "megavariable" whose values are all possible tuples of values of the individual state variables 
 for example, it determines that the clue "nice story" can be solved by "etage because its database includes the clue/solution pair "story in franceietage?' and because it recognizes that the patterns "nice xN and "x in france" often have the same solution 
 in this way, the original path-planning problem is reduced to finding a path on the voronoi diagram, which is generally one-dimensional (except in certain non-generic cases) and has finitely many points where three or more one-dimensional curves intersect 
 partial-order planners deal with this with causal links, a powerful representational approach, but unfortunately each conflict must be resolved with a choice (put the conflicting action before or after the link), and the choices can multiply exponentially 
 replacing an action with its deconnposition is a bit like transplant surgery: we have to take the new subplan out of its packaging (the start and fin,islz steps), constrction negates the permit, otherwise the same permit could be used to build many houses 
 so, just as evolution provides animals with enough built-in reflexes so that they can survive long enough to learn for themselves, it would be reasonable to provide an artificial intelligent agent with some initial knowledge as well as an ability to learn

 the hitech system, also a special-purpose computer, was designed by former world correspondence chess champion hans berliner and his student carl ebeling at cmu to allow rapid calculation of evaluation functions (ebeling, NNNN; berliner and ebeling, NNNN) 
 the model also contains unary relations, or properties: the "person" property is true of both richard and john; the "king" property is true only of john (presumably because richard is dead at this point); and the "crown" property is true only of the crown 
 thus, we can view the a virtualcounts and b hyperparameters as virtual counts, in the sense that a prior beta[a, b] behaves exactly as if we had started out with a uniform prior beta[l, NN and seen a - N actual cherry candies and b - N actual lime candies 
 alternatively, some redundant node generations can be avoided by viewing the set of goal states as a single state, each of whose predecessors is also a set of states-specifically, the set of states having a corresponding successor in the set of goal states 
 computational learning theory also brings sharply into focus the tradeoff between the expressiveness of the hypothesis language and the complexity of learning, and has led directly to an important class of learning algorithms called support vector machines 
 decision problems have a yes-or-no answer: is there a solution to this N-sat formula? counting problems have an integer answer: how many solutions are there to this N-sat formula? in some cases, the counting problem is much harder than the decision problem 
 eyes can also answer questions from the brain such as, "is there a gap between the left hand and the red box?" if you have a video camera, point it at the scene and allow the eyes to look at the viewfinder of the video camera, but not directly at the scene 
 for example, the first child of the first pair gets the first three digits from the first parent and the remaining digits from the second parent, whereas the second child gets the first three digits from the second parent and the rest from the first parent 
 goal test: are we at the destination by some prespecified time? N path cost: this depends on monetary cost, waiting time, flight time, customs and immigration procedures, seat quality, time of day, type of airplane, frequent-flyer mileage awards, and so on

 in a strictly logical kb, this would be a contradiction, but in a semantic network, the assertion that all persons have two legs has only default status; that is, a person is assumed to have two legs unless this is contradicted by more specific information 
 its space complexity is linear in the depth of the deepest optimal solution, but its time complexity is rather difficult to characterize: it depends both on the accuracy of the heuristic function and on how often the best path changes as nodes are expanded 
 notice that each time we consider generalizing or specializing the hypothesis, we miust check for consistency with the other examples, because an arbitrary increaseldecrease in the extension might includelexclude previously seen negativelpositive exaimples

 the difficulty lies in finding a representation of global shape that is general enough to deal with the wide variety of objects in the real world-not just simple forms like cylinders, cones, and spheres-and yet can be recovered easily from the visual input 
 the jtms assumes that sentences that are considesed once will probably be considered again, so rather than deleting a sentence from the knowledge base entirely when it loses all justifications, we merely mark the sentence as being out of the knowledge base

 which of these objections do you think is more likely? would it be a contradiction for someone to holcl both positions? ai: present and NN future in which we take stock of where we are and where we are going, this being a good thing to do before continuing 
 after such an experience, we would like the program to solve the same problem much more quickly the next time it arises memoization the technique of memoization has long been used in computer science to speed up programs by saving the results of computation 
 before tallying the counts in the distribution for the query variable, each event is weighted by the likelihood that the event accords to the evidence, as measured by the product of the conditional probabilities for each evidence variable, given its parents 
 for example, a planning agent that is in berkeley and wishes to be in monte carlo might first try to find a flight from san francisco to paris; given information about the departure and arrival times, it can then work on ways to get to and from the airports 
 gauss-jordan elimination works by repeatedly doing these operations in such a way that we start by eliminating the first variable (x) from all but the first equation and then continue on, eliminating the ith variable from all but the ith equation, for all i 
 if one had this capability, one could answer imalge queries such as "bill clinton and nelson mandela together," "a skater in mid-air," "the eiffel tower at night," and so on, without having had to type in caption keywords for each photograph in a collection 
 if you find this possibility confusing, remember that, in propositional logic, it is perfectly possible to have a model in which cloutly and sunny are both true; it is the job of the knowledge base to rule out models that are inconsistent with our knowledge 
 part v, uncertain knowledge and reasoning, is analogous to parts iNN and iv, but it concentrates on reasoning and decision making in the presence of uncertainty about the world, as might be faced, for example, by a system for medical diagnosis and treatment 
 to do fluent translation, a translator (human or machine) must read the original text, understand the situation to which it is referring, and find a corresponding text in the target language that does a good job of describing the same or a similar situation 
 applications in robotics promise to be particularly valuable; these will require methods for handling continuous, high-dimensional, partially observable environments in which successful behaviors may consist of thousands or even millions of primitive actions 
 biological naturalism in contrast, the biological naturalism theory says that mental states are high-level emergent features that are caused by low-level neurological processes in the neurons, and it is the (unspecified) properties of the neurons that matter 
 broadly speaking, there are two main approaches: brightness-based recognition, in which pixel brightness values are used directly, and feature-based recognition, which involves the use of spatial arrangements of extracted features such as edges or key points 
 for each pair of action names a and b, we would have next, we say that two action terms with the same action name refer to the same action only if they involve all the same objects: uniqueactlon axioms these are called, collectively, the unique action axioms 
 for example, a very large prolog-based natural language system designed for speech-to-speech translation between swedish and english was able to achieve real-time performance only by the application of ebl to the parsing process (samuelsson and rayner, NNNN)

 roughly speaking, a phone is the sound that corresponds to a single vowel or consonant, but there are some complications: combinations of letters, such as "th" and "ng" produce single phones, and some letters produce different phones in different contexts (e 
 search[-based techniques led to search in belief space (bonet and geffner, NNNN); satplan led to stochastic satplan (majercik and littman, NNNN) and to planning using quantified boolean logic (rintanen, NNNN); partial order planning led to uwl (etzioni et al 
 some researchers have explored the possibility of using dbns instead of hmms for speech, with the aim of using the greater expressive power of dbns to capture more of the complex hidden state of the speech apparatus (zweig and russell, NNNN; richardson et al 
 the derivation of numerical utilities from preferences was first carried out by ramsey (NNNN); the axioms for preference in the present text are closer in form to those rediscovered in theory of games and economic behavior (von neumann and morgenstern, NNNN) 
 the main difference between ida* and standard iterative deepening is that the cutoff used is the f -cost (g + h) rather than the depth; at each iteration, the cutoff value is the smallest f -cost of any node that exceeded the cutoff on the previous iteration 
 the modified smoothing algorithm works by first running the standard forward pass to compute ft:t (forgetting all the intermediate results) and then running the backward pass for both b and f together, using them to compute the smoothed estimate at each step 
 these data are noisy, quite literally: there can be background noise as well as artifacts introduced by the digitization process; there is variation in the way that words are pronounced, even by the same speaker; different words can sound the same; and so on 
 utility as an expression of preferences: in principle, basing rational decisions on the maximization of expected utility is completely general and avoids many of the problems of purely goal-based approaches, such as conflicting goals and uncertain attainment 
 a variety of statistical methods have been used to develop face detectors from image databases, including neural networks with raw pixel inputs, decision trees with features defined by various bar and edge filters, and naive bayes models with wavelet features 
 although doran and michie carried out theoretical analyses of path length and "penetrance" (the ratio of path length to the total number of nodes examined so far) in heuristic search, they appear to have ignored the information provided by current path length 
 an or gate's output is N if and only if any of its inputs is N: 'dg type(g) = or + signal (out (N,g)) = N @ N n signal(in(n, g)) = N lN note that we have used names beginning with appropriate letters-al, xi, and so on-purely to make the example easier to read 
 as a famous example, marcel proust's NNNN page novel a la rkcherclte du temps perdu begins and ends with the same word, so some translators have decided to do the same, thus basing the translation of a word on one that appeared roughly N million words earlier 
 bibliographical and historical notes the use of networks to represent probabilistic information began early in the NNth century, with the work of sewall wright on the probabilistic analysis of genetic inheritance and animal growth factors (wright, NNNN, NNNN) 
 if an agent maximizes a utility function that correctly reflects the performance measure by which its behavior is being judged, then it will achieve the higrhestpossible performance score if we average over the environments in which the agent couN,d be placed 
 since we are using the modell to make treatment decisions and not for other purposes (such as determining the joint probability of certain symptom/disorder combinations), we can often simplify by removing variables that are not involved in treatment decisions 
 the generation of complex behaviors can also be facilitated by hierarchical reinforcehierarchical reinforcement ment learning methods, which attempt to solve problems at multiple levels of abstraction- learning much like the htn planning methods of chapter NN 
 the material in this section is quite technical, but the basic claim is straightforward: the ,sampling process settles into a "dynamic equilibrium" in which the long-run fraction of time spent in each state is exactly proportional to its posterior probability 
 the motivating examples were in domains such as optical character recognition and handwritten zip code recognition where the primary concern is that of learning the typical variations characteristic of a class of objects and separating them from other classes 
 the outputs of the circuit are registers corresponding to actions-for example, lN the observant reader will have noticed that this allowed us to finesse the connection between the raw percepts such as breeze and the location-specific propositions such as bliN

 they are able to accept new tasks in the form of explicitly described goals, they can achieve competence quickly by being told or learning new knowledge about the environment, and they can adapt to changes in the environment by updating the relevant knowledge 
 think about such things as grammar, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, compositionality, context-dependence, lexical ambiguity, syntactic ambiguity, reference finding (including pronouns), background knowledge, and what it means t:o "nderstand" in the first place 
 ) the lrta* algorithm was developed by korf (NNNN) as part of an investigation into real-timesearch real-time search for environments in which the agent must act after searching for only a fixed amount of time (a much more common situation in two-player games)

 a single-language parsing system could use predicates like open(x), but for translation, the representation language would have to make more distinctions, perhaps with openl (x) representing the "offen" sense and opena (x) representing the "neu eroffnet" sense 
 are you being irrational? expected monetaw value assuming you believe that the coin is fair, the expected monetary value (emv) of the gamble is &($o) -t &($N,NNN,NNN) = $N,NNN,NNN, and the emv of taking the orignnal prize is of course $N,NNN,NNN, which is less 
 for example, fitting straight lines to data is very easy; fitting high-degree polynomials is harder; and fitting turing machines is very hard indeed because determining whether a given turing machine is consistent with the data is not even decidable in general 
 formally, the axiom is: this gives us functionality that is similar to situation calculus, but with the ability to talk about time points and intervals, so we can say happens(turnofl(lightswitchl), N:oo) to say that a lightswitch was turned off at exactly N:NN 
 lucas (NNNN) have claimed that this theorem shows that machines are mentally inferior to humans, because machines are formal systems that are limited by the incompleteness theorem-they cannot establish the truth of their own godel sentence-while NNN chapter NN 
 prior to the execution of a, the agent assigns probability p(result, (a) i do (a), e) to each outcome, where e summarizes the agent's available evidence about the world and do(a) is the proposition that action a is executed in the current expectedutility state 
 probabilistic language processing reciprocal rank time to answer case folding stemming synonyms spelling correction metadata recall and precision were defined when ir searches were done primarily by librarians who were interested in thorough, scholarly results 
 recalling that a can be named by a given set of integers, we can imagine writing in our language a sentence a(j, a) of the following sort: v i i is not the godel number of a proof of the sentence whose godel number is j, where the proof uses only premises in a 
 the solution we mentioned before is to have each leaf node report either the majority classification for its set of examples, if a deterministic hypothesis is required, or report the estimated probabilities of each classification using the relative frequencies 
 therefore, the best solution is for each ordering constraint to record the reason for the constraint; then, when a high-level action is expanded, the new ordering constraints can be as relaxed as possible, consistent with the reason for the original constraint 
 a propositional logic is reasonably effective for centain tasks within an agent, but does not scale to environments of unbounded size because it lacks the expressive power to deal concisely with time, space, and universal patterns of relationships among objects 
 agents using this approach can tailor their effort to handle time pressure and generate some interesting behaviors such as using familiar "beaten paths" to find their way around the state space quickly without having to recompute optimal decisions at each point 
 each such agent implements a function that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to represent these functions, such as production systems, reactive agents, real-time cortditional planners, neural networks, and decision-theoretic systems 
 exploration, whetheir it is exploration of a new research field or exploration of a new shopping mall, is risky, is expensive, and has uncertain payoffs; on the other hand, failure to explore at all means that one never discovers any actions that are worthwhile 
 flies are the most dexterous fliers of any animal or machine, and it is interesting that they do it with a vision system that has terrible spatial resolution (having only about NNN receptors compared to a human's NNN million) but spectacular temporal resolution 
 for example, the use of a naive bayes model for the restaurant problem assumes that p(fri/sat, bar( will wait) = p(fri/sat ( will wait)p(bar( will wait) and we can check in the data that the same equation holds between the corresponding conditioilal frequencies 
 goals just provide a crude binary distinction between "happy" and "unhappy" states, whereas a more general performance measure should allow a comparison of different world states according to exactly how happy they would make the agent if they could be achieved 
 here are two rules that allow propositional and adverbial adjuncts on any vp: vp(subcat) -i vp(subcat) pp i vp(subcat) adverb generative capacity of augmented grammars ruleschema each augmented rule is a rule schema, that stands for a set of rules, one for each

 the initiates and terminates relations play a role similar to the result relation in situation calculus; initiates(e, f, t) means that the occurrence of event e at time t causes fluent f to become true, while terminates (w , f, t) means that f ceases to be true 
 this raises an obvious question: if the algorithm induces a consistent, but incorrect, tree from the examples, how incorrect will the tree be? we will show how to analyze this question experimentally, after we explain the details of the attribute selection step

 a solid foundation for game theory was developed in the seminal work theory of games and economic behavior (von neumann and morgenstern, NNNN), which included an analysis showing that some games require strategies that are randomized (or otherwise unpredictable) 
 for example, we might be uncertain about the prior probability p(tachycardia), but if we try many different values for this probability and in each case the recommended action of the influence diagram is the same then we can be less concerned about our ignorance 
 furthermore, medical diagnosis is episodic if one conceives of the task as selecting a diagnosis given a list of s:ymptoms; the problem is sequential if the task can include proposing a series of tests, evaluating progress over the course of treatment, and so on 
 i representing a decision problem with a decision network in its most general form, a decision network represents information about the agent's current state, its possible actions, the state that will result from the agent's action, and the utility of that state

 the complete process for defining magic sets and rewriting the knowledge base is too complex to go into here, but the basic idea is to perform a sort of "generic" backward inference from the goal in order to work out which variable bindings need to be constrained 
 the main point of this section is to show that some knowledge representation-in particular, the product hierarchy-is necessary for an agent like this, and that once we have some knowledge in this form, it is not too hard to do the rest as a itnowledge-based agent 
 the original horn program (left) lists four courses explicitly and also asserts that there is an ee class for every integer from NNN to NNN, and that for every cs class in the NNN (undergraduate) series, there is a corresponding class in the NNN (graduate) series 
 typically a hierarchy of wrappers would be applied to a page: a very general one to extract dates and prices, a more specific one to extract attributes for computer-related products, and if necessary a site-specific one that knows the format of a particular store 
 formally, a mechanism mechanism consists of (N) a language for describing the (possibly infinite) set of allowable strategies that agents may adopt and (N) an outcome rule g that determines the payoffs to the agents given a strategy profile of allowable strategies 
 in this chapter, we return to the idea of utility theory that was introduced in chapter NN and show how it is combined with probability theory to yield a decision-theoretic agent-an agent that can make rational decisions based on what it believes and what it wants

 it is often the case that the population is quite diverse early on in the process, so crossover (like simulated annealing) frequently takes large steps in the state space early in the search process and smaller steps later on when most individuals are quite similar 
 local search algorithms and optimization problems NNN simulated annealing search a hill-climbing algorithm that never makes "downhill" moves towards states with lower value (or higher cost) is guaranteed to be incomplete, because it can get stuck on a local maximum 
 on the other hand, artificial aowers are not flowers, and daniel dennett points out that artificial chateau latour wine would not be chateau latour wine, even if it was chemically indistinguishable, simply because it was not made in the right place in the right way 
 the final step is to show how to choose between policies, bearing in mind that a given policy Nr generates not one state sequence, but a whole range of possible state sequences, each with a specific probability determined by the transition model for the environment

 usually, the next sentence of english corresponds to the next sentence of french in a N : N match, but sometimes there is variation: one sentence in one language will be split into a N:l match, or the order of two sentences will be swapped, resulting in a N:N match 
 " alan turing, in his famous paper "computing machinery and intelligence" (turing, NNNN), suggested that instead of asking whether machines can think, we should ask whether machines can pass a behavioral intelligence test, which has come to be called the turing test 
 as well as interpreting the new percept in the light of existing knowledge about the state, it uses information about how the world evolves to keep track of the unseen parts of the world, and also must know about what the agent's actions do to the state of the world 
 curiously, unilaterally choosing a particular action does not harm one's expected payoff, but allowing the other agent to know that one has made such a unilateral decision does affect the expected payoff, because then the opponent can adjust his strategy accordingly 
 e adding burglary: if we know the alarm state, then the call from john or mary might give us information about our phone ringing or m,ary's music, but not about burglary: p(burglary(alarm, johncalls, marycalls) = ed(burglarylalarm) hence we need just alarm as parent

 the discipline imposed in aN by the need for one's theories to "work" has led to more rapid and deeper progress than was the case when these problems were the exclusive domain of philosophy (although it has at limes also led to the repeated reinvention of the wheel) 
 we will also find it convenient to define a modified error ai = erri x gf(ini), so that the weiglit-update rule becomes to update the connections between the input units and ithe hidden units, we need to define a quantity analogous to the error term for output nodes 
 because the agent's utility function seldom refers to the contents of the agent's internal state, whereas the whole purpose of sensing actions is to affect the internal state, we must evaluate sensing actions by their effect on the agent's subsequent "realN ' actions 
 drawing on models of limited shortterm memory in humans, this algorithm maintains a tabu list of k previously visited states that cannot be revisited; as well as improving efficiency when searching graphs, this can allow the algorithm to escape from some local minima

 utility principle if an agent's preferences obey the axioms of utility, then there exists a real-valued function u that operates on states such that u(a) > u(b) if and only if a is preferred to b, and u(a) = u(b) if and only if the agent is indifferent between a and b 
 what aspect of the temporal process do the weights in the gaussian mixture represent? together, the results in (a) and (b) show that the representation of the posterior grows without limit even for switching kalman filters, which are the simplest hybrid dynamic models 
 but finding the solution can be difficult because the average branching factor is huge: each of the NN planes can fly to N other airports, and each of the NNN packages can be either unloaded (if it is loaded), or loaded into any plane at its airport (if it is unloaded) 
 given that the coin might or might not be fair, what belief should you ascribe to tlhe event that it comes up heads? dempster-shafer theory says that because you have no evidence either way, you have to say that the belief beN (heads) == N and also that bel(Nheads) = N

 for example, plan N for the tennis problem can be represented as this sequence of joint actlons: (go(a, [left, net]), go(b, [right, baseline])) (noop(a), hit(b, ball)) we could do planning using the regular pop algorithm, applied to the set of all possible joint actions 
 good behavior: the concept of rationality NN that if we expect an agent to do what turns out to be the best action after the fact, it will be impossible to design an agent to fulfill this specification-unless we improve the peirformance of crystal balls or time machines

 discussion let's begin with the bad news: pure htn planning (where the only allowable plan refinement is decomposition) is undecidable, even though the underlying state space isfinite! this might seem very depressing, since the point of htn planning is to gain efficiency 
 if all utility functions were as arbitrary as this, however, then utility theory would not be of much help because we would have to observe the agent's preferences in every possible combination of circumstances before being able to make any predictions about its behavior 
 if we try to build a diagnostic model with links from symptoms to causes (as from mary calls to alarm or alarm to burglary), we end up having to specify additional dependencies between otherwise independent causes (and often between separately occurring symptoms as well) 
 intelligent agents the goal-based view also dominates the cognitive psychology tradition in the area of problem solving, beginning with the enormously influential human problem solving (newelN and simon, NNNN) and running through all of newell's later work (newell, NNNN) 
 logical agents function kb-aen(percept) returns an action static: kb, a knowledge base t, a counter, initially N, indicating time tell(kb, make-percept-sentence(, t)) action t ask(kb, make-action- query(^)) tell(kb, make-action-sentence(, t)) ttt+l return action figure N 
 mechanism design NN N examples of mechanism design include auctioning off cheap airline tickets, routing tcp packets between computers, deciding how medical interns will be assigned to hospitals, and deciding how robotic soccer players will cooperate with their teammates 
 partial-order planning NNN causal links achieves conflicts open preconditions partial-order plan: total-order plans: right p N finish start start left left right right left sock leftsockon rightsockon shoe shoe left leftshoeon, rightshoeon i a set of ordering constraints 
 suppose we have examples x, with classifications y, = f N and we want to find an optimal separator in the input space; thein the quadratic programming problem lN the reader may notice that we could have used just fl and fi, but the N'd mapping illustrates the idea better 
 there are two major characteristics of generalpurpose ontologies that distinguish them from collections of special-purpose ontologies: a general-purpose ontology should be applicable in more or less any special-purpose domain (with the addition of domain-specific axioms) 
 this chapter has addressed the following issues: philosophers use the term weak aN for the hypothesis that machines could possibly behave intelligently, and strong aN for the hypothesis that such machines would count as having actual minds (as opposed to simulated minds) 
 this statement can be proven by showing that a given determination is logically equivalent to a statement that the correct definition of the target predicate is one of the set of all definitioins expressible using the predicates on the left-hand side of the determination 
 ) if you consider each arm in an n-armed bandit problem to be a possible string of genes, and the investment of a coin in one arm to be the reproduction of those genes, then genetic algorithms allocate coins optimally, given an appropriate set of independeince assumptions 
 for example, if the training set consists of a set of photographs, and the new stimulus is a small piece of one of the photographs, then the network activation levels will reproduce the photograph from which the piece was lvhis approximately confirmed "uncle bernie's rule 
 the "intelligence explosion" has also been called the technological singularity by mathe- singularity maN:ics professor and science fiction author vernor vinge, who writes (NNNN), "within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence 
 we can measure the deviation by comparing the actual numbers of positive and negative examples in each subset, pi and ni, with the expected numbers, pi and fii, assuming true irrelevance: * in fact, the gain will be positive unless the proportions are all exactly the same 
 but this does not mean that the aN problem is solved by the definition! although the meu principle defines the right action to take in any decision problem, the computations involved can be prohibitive, and it is sometimes difficult even to formulate the problem completely 
 for example, "give" can be made into a complete vp by adding [np, pp], "give the gold" can be made complete by adding [pp], and "give the gold to me" is already a complete vp; therefore its this is one definition of complenzent, but other authors have different terminology 
 if the sensor returns NN readings of N followed by NN readings of N, then the transient sensor failure model described in the preceding paragraph will result in the robot gradually coming to believe that its battery is empty when in fact it may be that the meter has failed 
 it could be that a given grammar has no way to express the logical form x a y for some values of x and y, but can express y a x; this suggests that we need a way to canonicalize semantic forms, or we need to extend the unification routine so that x a y can unify with y a x 
 syllogisms were categorized by "figures" and "moods," depending on the order of the terms (which we would call predicates) in the sentences, the degree of generality (which we would today interpret through quantifiers) applied to each term, and whether each term is negated 
 this time there is no way to resolve the conflict with leaveovernight: we cannot order it before start (because nothing can come before start), and we cannot order it after remove(spare, trunk) (because there is already a constraint ordering it before remove(spare, trunk)) 
 we have described a reasoning process whose conclusions are guaranteed to be true in any world in which the premises are true; in particular, if kb is true in the real world, then any sentence ol derivedfrorn kb by a sound inference procedure is also true in the real world 
 we suspect that a science of artificial intelligence based on bounded optimality will involve a good deal of study of the processes that allow an agent program to converge to bounded optimality and perhaps less concentration on the details of the messy programs that result 
 with parent(george, elizabeth) as cN, one possible clause cN is the hypothesis parent (x, z) a parent (z, y) + grandparent (x, y) now we have a resolution proof that the hypothesis, descriptions, and background knowledge entail the classification grandparent (george, anne) 
 y problem: given a sentence of propositional logic, is there an assignment of truth values to the proposition symbols of the sentence that make it true? unless a miracle occurs and p = np, there can be no algorithm that solves all satisfiability problems in polynomial time 
 failure to come to grips with the "combinatorial explosion" was one of the main criticisms of aN contained in the lighthill report (lighthill, NNNN), which formed the basis for the decision by the british government to end support for aN research in all but two universities 
 for example, we have listed chess as fully observable; strictly speaking, this is false because certain rules about castling, en passant capture, and draws by repetition require remembering some facts about the game history that are not observable as part of the board state 
 helmert (NNNN) analyzes several classes of planning problems, and shows that constraint-based approaches, such as graphplan and satplan are best for nphard domains, while search-based approaches do better in domains where feasible solutions can be found without backtracking 
 in ai, the principal reference for maut is wellman's (NNNN) paper, which includes a system called urp (utility reasoning package) that can use a collection of statements about preference independence and conditional independence to analyze the structure of decision problems 
 in fact, loolung more carefully, we see that none of the state variables has any evidence variables among its ancestors! hence, although the weight of each sample will depend on the evidence, the actual set of samples generated will be completely independent of the evidence 
 in our discussion of likelihood weighting in chapter NN, we pointed out that the algorithm's accuracy suffers if the evidence variables are "downstream" from the variables being sampled, because in that case the samples are gener,ated without any influence from the evidence 
 it is interesting to note that the data association problem is an instance of probabilistic inference in a first-order language; unlike most probabilistic inference problems, which are purely prlopositional, data association involves objects as well as the identity relation 
 mechanism design became more than an academic subject in the NNNNs when several nations, faced with the problem of auctioning off licenses to broadcast in various frequency bands, lost hundreds of millions of dollars in potential revenue as a result of poor mechanism design 
 once we add in the other inference rules besides modus ponens, we will be able to answer questions of the form "given that a logical agent knocvs these premises, can it draw that conclusion?" besides the normal inference rules, we need some rules that are specific to belief 
 one potentially confusing point is that in one sense generalized modus ponens is less general than modus ponens (page NN N): modus ponens allows any single a on the left-hand side of the implication, while generalized modus ponens requires a special format for this sentence 
 other types of mobile robots include unmanned air vehicles (uav), commonly used for surveillance, crop-spraying, and military operations, autonomous underwater vehicles (auv), used in deep sea exploration, and planetary rovers, such as the sojourner robot shown in figure NN 
 answer set programming can be seen as an extension of negation as failure or as a refinement of circumscription; the underlying theory of stable model semantics was introduced by gelfond and lifschitz (NNNN) and the leading answer set programming systems are dlv (eiter et al 
 for example, in a census database it would be reasonable to make the cwa when reasoning about the current population of cities, but it would be wrong to conclude that no baby will ever be born in the future just because the database contains no entries with future birthdates 
 for example, mutations can involve reversals, duplications, and movement of large chunks of dna; some viruses borrow dna from one organism and insert it in another; and there are transposable genes that do nothing but copy themselves many thousands of times within the genome 
 it might have instruments that are not available to the average human driver: a satellite global positioning system (gps) to give it accurate position information with respect to an electronic map, and infrared or sonar sensors to detect distances to other cars and obstacles 
 it turns out that the second and third options are roughly equivalent, but we will use the third option, knowledge propositions, because it gives a more vivid description of sensing and because we already know how to write strips descriptions with the closed-world assumption 
 knowledge-based systems: the key to power? (NNNN-NNNN) the picture of problem solving that had arisen during the first decade of aN research was of a general-purpose search mechanism trying to string together elementary reasoning steps to weak methods find complete solutions 
 max therefore must find a contingent strategy, which specifies max's move in the initial state, then max's moves in the states reslting from every possible response by min, then max's moves in the states resulting from every possible response by min to those moves, and so on 
 sensor modeling is also a vast subfield in itself, but even subtle phenomena, such as sensor drift, sudden decalibration, and the effects of exogenous csonditions (such as weather) on sensor readings, can be handled by explicit representation within dynamic bayesian networks 
 such rewards can speed up learning enormously, and are very simple to provide, but there is a risk that the agent will learn to maximize the pseudorewards rather than the true rewinds; for example, standing next to the ball and "vibrating" causes many contacts with the balll 
 summary NNN - bibliographical and historical notes although even aristotle's logic deals with generalizatnons over objects, true first-order logic dates from the introduction of quantifiers in gottlob frege's (NNNN) begriffschrift ("concept writing" or "conceptual notation") 
 the main difference is that the passive learning agent does not know the transition model t(s, a, s'), which specifies the probability of reaching state s' from state s after doing action a; nor does it know the reward function r(s), which specifies the reward for each state 
 the most recent work appears in the proceedings of the major aN conferences: the biennial international joint conference on aN (ijcai), the annual european conference on aN (ecai), and the national conference on ai, more often known as aaai, after its sponsoring organization 
 the notion of a bayes-nash equilibrium partially addresses this point: it is an equilibrium with respect to a player's prior probability distribution over the other players' strategies-in other words, it expresses a player's beliefs about the other players' likely strategies 
 the process continues in this way until we have generated m hypotheses, where m is for learning algorithms in which this is not possible, one can instead create a replicated training set where the ith example appears w, times, using randomization to handle fractional weights 
 even more fundamentally, because they lacked a concise formalism (such as the one to be described in chapter NN) for representing and using conditional independence information, they depended on the acquisition, storage, and processing of enormous tables of probabilistic data 
 he further suggests that one could imagine the human memorizing the rule book and the contents of all the stacks of paper, so that there would be nothing to have understanding except the human; and again, when one asks the human (in english), the reply will be in the negative 
 this is because it uses the ve'i formula shortsightedly, calculating function infrmation-gathering-agent(c) returns an action static: d, a decision network integrate percept into d j +- the value that maximizes vpi (ej) - cost (ej) if vpi(ej) > cost(ej) then return request(e, 
 this is important because the offer at a given store may change from day to day even for the same individual laptop; for some categories-such as houses and paintings-tlhe same individual object may even be offered simultaneously by different intermediaries at different prices 
 we can describe this as a formal planning problem as follows: goal (rightshoeon a leftshoeon) init () action(rightshoe, precond: rightsocfon, effect: rightshoeon) action(rightsocf, eec:rightsockon) action(leftshoe; precond:lsoo, et:leftshoeon) action (leftsock, et:leftsockon) 
 " one preference rightassociation heuristic is the rule of right association, which says that when it is time to decide where in the parse tree to place the pp "in N,N," we should prefer to attach it to the rightmost existing constituent, which in this case is the np "a wumpus 
 now, if every hmm is a dbn and every dbn can be translated into an hmm, what's the difference? the difference is that, by decomposing the state of a complex system into its constituent variables, the dbn is able to take advantage of sparseness in the temporal probability model 
 one might say that game playing is to aN as grand prix motor racing is to the car industry: state-of-the-art game programs are blindingly fast, incredibly well-tuned machines that incorporate very advanced engineering techniques, but they aren't much use for doing the shopping 
 the precise definition of the task environment is given, as suggested in chapter N, by the peas description: N performance measure: +iNNN for piclung up the gold, -NNNN for falling into a pit or being eaten by the wumpus, -N for each action taken and -NN for using up the arrow 
 when we look at the syntax of natural language, the most objects obvious elements are nouns and noun phrases that refer to objects (squares, pits, wumpuses) relations and verbs and verb phrases that refer to relations among objects (is breezy, is adjacent to, functions shoots) 
 aN is the only one of these fields that is clearly a branch of computer science (although operations research does share an emphasis on computer simulations), and aN is the only field to attempt to build machines that will function autonomously in complex, changing environments 
 efficient representation of conditional distributions NN N cold flu alanal p(fever) N p(lNNever) N in general, noisy logical relationships in which a variable depends on k parents can be described using o(k) parameters instead of N(Nk) for the full conditional probability table 
 in the late NNNNs, wiener, along with warren mcculloch, walter NNitts, and john von neumann, organized a series of conferences that explored the nevv mathematical and computationall models of cognition and influenced many other researchers in the cyberne ics behavioral sciences 
 the partial solution of the representational frame problem using successorstate axioms is due to ray reiter (NNNN); a solution of the inferential frame problem can be traced to work by holldobler and schneeberger (NNNN) on what became known as fluent calculus (thielscher, NNNN) 
 trying to use first-order logic to cope with a domain like medical diagnosis thus fails for three main reasons: laziness N laziness: it is too much work to list the complete set of antecedents or consequents needed to ensure an exceptionless rule and too haird to use such rules 
 ultimately, this is what really matters, but a benchmark can be unsatisfactory because it is so specific: it measures the performance of a particular program written in a particular language, running on a particular computer, with a particular compiler and particular input data 
 a conditional planner would just assume that the effect has occurred once the action has been executed, but a replanning agent would check for the effect, and if it were not true (perhaps because the agent was careless and missed a spot), it could then replan to repaint the spot 
 a number of early philosophical responses to turing's (NNNN) "computing machinery and intelligence," for example, scriven (NNNN), attempted to deny that it was even meaningful to say that machines could think, on the ground that such an assertion violated the meaning of the word 
 atanasoff's research received little support or recognition; it was the eniac, developed as part of a secret military project at the university of pennsylvania by a team including john mauchly and john eckert, that proved to be the most influential forerunner of modern computers 
 the comparison raises a general question: is it better to learn a model and a utility function or to learn an action-value function with no model? in other words, what is the best way to represent the agent function? this is an issue at the foundations of artificial intelligence 
 the main points are as follows: e sequential decision problems in uncertain envirsinments, also called markov decision processes, or mdps, are defined by a transition model specifying the probabilistic outcomes of actions and a reward function specifying the reward in each state 
 the question remains, what should a rational agent actually do in playing a single game of morra? the rational agent will have derived the fact that [N/NN: one; N/NN: two] is the maximin equilibrium strategy, and will assume that this is mutual knowledge with a rational opponent 
 the utility of player i in terms of his bid bi, his value vi, and the best bid among the other players, b, is to see that bi = vi is a dominant strategy, note that when (vi - b,) is positive, any bid that wins the auction is optimal, and bidding vi in particular wins the auction 
 there is a price to pay for this convenience: vve are providing the grammar writer with the full power of a theorem-prover, so we give up the guarantees of o(nN) syntactic parsing; parsing with augmentations can be np-complete or (even undecidable, depending on the augmentations 
 ) where would they fit in a more general hierarchy? what are the constraints and interrelationships among them? how detailed must you be about each of the various concepts? the knowledge base you construct must be capable of answering a list of questions that we will give shortly 
 a hopfield network associative memory functions as an associative memory: after the network trains on a set of examples, a new stimulus will cause it to settle into an activation pattern corresponding to the example in the training set that most closely resembles the new stimulus 
 can you improve its accuracy stylometry with additional features? this subfield of linguistics is called stylometry; its successes include the identification of the author of the federalist papers (mosteller and wallace, NNNN) and some disputed works of shakespeare (foster, NNNN) 
 in each case, the learning methods can be understood as searching a hypothesis space to find a suitable function, starting from only a very basic assumption about the form of the function, such as "second degree polynomial" or "decision tree" and a bias such as "simpler is better 
 N (a) a node x is conditionally zijs) given its parents (the uis shown in the independent of all other nodes in the network there is also a general topological criterion called d-separation for deciding whether a set of nodes x is independent of another set y, given a third set z 
 of course, we have not yet said what "isomorphic" really means, but the assumption is that there is some level of abstraction below which the specific implementation does not matter; as long as the processes are isomorphic down to the this level, the same mental states will occur 
 that is, the successor-state and precondition axioms allow a plane to fly to two destinations at once! the preconditions for the two flights by pN are satisfied in the initial state; the successor-state axioms say that pN will be at sfN and lax at time N; so the goal is satisfied 
 and events NNN to make these numbers easier to read, we also introduce a function date, which takes six arguments (hours, minutes, seconds, day, month, and year) and returns a time point: time(start(adNNNN)) = date(N, o,o,l, jan, NNNN) date(o,NN,NN,NN,N,NNNN) = seconds(NNNNNNNNNN) 
 how exactly do we design good evaluation functions? first, the evaluation function should order the terminal states in the same way as the true utility function; otherwise, an agent using it miglht select suboptimal moves even if it can see ahead all the way to the end of the game 
 if we restrict our attention to the positive part of (he curves, where the slope is decreasing, then for any lottery l, the utility of being faced with that lottery is less than the utility of being handed the expected monetary value of the lottery as a sure thing: u(l) < (semvl)) 
 jevons (NNNN), who wrote, "the study both of forrnal logic and of the theory of probabilities has led me to adopt the opinion that there is no such thing as a distinct method of induction as contrasted with deduction, but that induction is simply an inverse employment of deduction 
 methods for selecting optimal airline flights remain proprietary for the most part, but carl de marcken (personal communication) has shown that airline ticket pricing and restrictions have become so convoluted that the problem of selecting an optimal flight is formally undecidable 
 much of the early work in knowledge representation (the study of how to put knowledge into a form that a computer can reason with) was tied to language and informed by research in linguistics, which was connected in turn to decades of work on the philosophical analysis of language 
 that is, an agent in a competitive environment must (a) recognize that there are other agents, (b) compute some of the other agent's possible plans, (c) compute how the other agent's plans interact with its own plans, and (d) decide on the best action in view of these interactions 
 the example also illustrates a significant problem with maximum-likelihood learning in general: when the data set is small enough that some events have not yet been observed-for instance, no cherry candies-the maximum i'ikelihood hypothesis assigns zero probability to those events 
 the lexical categories are cilty, plural noun, and (transitive) verb, and there should be one grammar rule for sentence, one for verb phrase, and three for noun phrase: plural noun, noun phrase preceded by a city as a modifier, and noun phrase followed by a reduced relative clause 
 this would be realundant and inefficient, however, for the same reason that constraint satisfaction algorithms don't include successors for every possible variable: the order in which we consider open preccnditions (like the order in which we consider csp variables) is commutative 
 we have many examples showing that this can be done successfully in other areas: for example, the huge tables of square roots used by engineers and schoolchildren prior to the NNNNs have now been replaced by a five-line program for newton's method running on electronic calculators 
 , NNNN) showed that the run time distributions of systematic backtracking algorithms often have a heavy-tailed holstrleurlon eavy-tailed distribution, which means that the probability of a very long run time is more than would be predicted if the run times were normally distributed 
 for example, we might have the following: source french: le chien brun n' est pas allN a la maison target english: the brown dog did not go home word alignment: N N N NN N NN first, using the current estimates of the parameters, create a word alignment vector for each sentence pair 
 in NNNN, kurt godel (NNNN-NNNN) showed that there exists an effective procedure to prove any true statement in the first-order logic of frege and russell, but that first-order logic could not capture the principle of mathematical induction needed to characterize the natural numbers 
 informally, we may think of x and y as the number of men and women sitting at a table playilng bridge, for example, and the sentence x + y = N is true when there are four in total; formally, the possible models are just all possible assignments of numbers to the variables NN: and y 
 it is common in the database world to assume that both the sizes of rules and the arities of predicates are bounded by a constant and to worry data complexity only about data complexity-that is, the complexity of inference as a function of the number of ground facts in the database 
 it is natural to ask, "which of the agent architectures in chapter N should an agent use?" the answer is, "all of them!" we have seen that reflex responses are needed for situations in which time is of the essence, whereas knowledge-based deliberation allows the agent to section NN 
 N x NN-lN words bayes information retrieval model n p(qpi, r) N p(qidi, r) two document models-di is an unsmoothed unigram word tnodel of the ith document, and d: is the same model with add-one smoothing-and compute the probability of the query i given each document for both models 
 notice the direction of the dependence: the "arrow" goes from state to sensor values because the state of the world causes the sensors to take on the transition model is the probabilistic analog of the boolean update circuits in chapter N and the successorstate axioms in chapter NN 
 the existence of the chain itself is determined by a recursive definition, with the empty chain (start = end) as the base case: relevantchain(start, end, query) @ (start = end) v (N u, text linktext(start, u, text) a relevantcategoryname(query, text) a relevantchain(u, end, query)) 
 thus, to find out how many legs mary has, the inheritance algorithm follows the memberof link from mary to the category she belongs to, and then follows subsetof links up the hierarchy until it finds a category for which there is a boxed legs link-in this case, the persons category 
 to see why, consider the following questions: can machines fly? can machines swim? most people agree that the answer to the first question is yes, airplanes can fly, but the answer to the second is no; boats and submarines do move through the water, but we do not call that swimming 
 we also note that humanity has survived other setbacks to our sense of uniqueness: de revolutionibus orbiunz coelestium (copernicus, NNNN) moved the earth away from the center of the solar system and descent of man (darwin, NNN N) put homo sapiens at the same level as other species 
 we have already noted the connection between finding a satisfying model for a logical sentence and finding a solution for a constraint satisfaction problem, so it is perhaps not surprising that the two families of algorithms closely resemble the backtracking algorithms of scction N 
 algorithms that work from left to right and avoid left-corner building these impossible constituents are called left-corner parsers, because they build up a parse tree that starts with the grammar's start symbol and extends down to the leftmost word in the sentence (the left corner) 
 building a speech recognizer the quality of a speech recognition system depends on the quality of all of its componentsthe language model, the word pronunciation models, the phone models, and the signal processing algorithms used to extract spectral features from the acoustic signal 
 but computer agents are expected to have other attributes that distinguish them from mere "programs," such as operating under autonomous control, perceiving their environment, persisting over a prolonged time period, adapting to change, and being capable of taking on another's goals 
 car manufacturers sell spare tires and air bags, which are physical embodiments of conditional plan branches designed to handle punctures or crashes; on the other hand, most car drivers never consider these possibilities, so they respond to punctures and crashes as replanning agents 
 followers of aN should be encouraged that current techniques are much more practical than those of NNNN; for example the planning algorithms in the first edition could generate plans of only dozens of steps, while the algorithms in this edition scale up to tens of thousands of steps 
 it would be absurd to suppose that one must visit all these states in order to learn how to play the game! function approximation one way to handle such problems is to use function approximation, which simply means using any sort of representation for the function other than a table 
 NN followed by various technical specifications, we would like a wrapper to extract information such as the following: N lc, oger lc e laptopcomputers a o#er e productoflers a screensixe(lc, inches(lN)) a screentype(lc, colorlcd) a memorysize(lc, megabytes(NNN)) a cpuspeed(lc, ghz(N 
 speech recognition research is published in computer speech and language, speech communications, and the ieee transactions on acoustics, speech, and signal processing and at the darpa workshops on speech and natural language processing and the eurospeech, icslp, and asru conferences 
 there is a problem: when the knowledge base includes a function symbol, the set of possible ground term substitutions is infinite! for example, if the knowledge base mentions the father symbol, then infinitely many nested terms such as father(father(father(jNhn))) can be constructed 
 ) the principal proponent of this view has been the philosopher hubert dreyfus, who has produced a series of influential critiques of artificial intelligence: what computers can't do (NNNNN, what computers still can't do (NNNNN, and, with his brother stuart, mind over machine (N NNN) 
 a heuristic h(n) is consistent if, for every node n and every successor n' of n generated by any action a, the estimated cost of reaching the goal from n is no greater than the step cost of getting to n' plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal from n': h(n) N c(n, a, n') t h(nf) 
 although local search algorithms are not systematic, they have two key advantages: (N) they use very little memory-usually a constant amount; and (N) they can often find reasonable solutions in large or infinite (continuous) state spaces for which systematic algorithms are unsuitable 
 designers can build a large network and still have a good idea about what queries will be efficient, because (a) it is easy to visualize the steps that the inference procedure will go through and (b) in some cases the query language is so simple that difficult queries cannot be posed 
 for example, the familiar rule for negation follows by substituting la for b in axiom N, giving us: p(a v la) = p(a) + p(Na) - p(a a la) ('by axiom N with b = la) p(true) = p(a) + p(Na) - p(faNse) (iby logical equivalence) N = p(a) + p(Na) (iby axiom N) p(Na) = N - p(a) (lby algebra) 
 he cites the following dialog, which has become such a part of ai's oral tradition that we simply have to include it: human: in the first line of your sonnet which reads "shall i compare thee to a summer's day," would not a "spring day" do as well or better? machine: it wouldn't scan 
 NN is reinforcement learning an appropriate abstralct model for evolution? what connection exists, if any, between hardwired reward signals and evolutionary fitness? in which we see why agents might want to exchange information-carrying messages with each other and how they can do so

 they assume the end and consider how and by what means it is attained, and if it seems easily and best produced thereby; while if it is achieved by one means only they consider how it will be achieved by this and by what means this will be achieved, till they come to the first cause, 
 yet none of the algorithms we have described can handle continuous state spaces-the successor function would in most cases return infinitely many states! this section provides a very brief introduction to some local search techniques for finding optimal solutions in continuous spaces

 for collections of agents, it holds the possibility of using game-theoretic mechanisms to construct smart systems out of a collection of more limited systems--even noncooperative systems-in much the same way that teams of humans can achieve goals far beyond the reach of any individual 
 for example, if "cars have four wheels" is false, what does it mean to have it in one's knowledge base? what is a good set of default rules to have? if we cannot decide, for each rule separately, whether it belongs in our knowledge base, then we have a serious problem of nonmodularity 
 for example, we can resolve the two clauses [animal (f(x)) v loves (g(x), x)] and [iloves(u, v) v lkzlls(u, v)] by eliminating the complementary literals loves(g(x), x) and lloves(u, v), with unifier N' = {u/g(x), vlx), to produce the resolvent clause [animal (p(x)) v kzlls (g(x), x)]

 note also that because, from every frame to the next frame, there is only a small change in the position of the projection of the lane in the image, one knows where to look for the lane markers in the image-in the figure, we need to look only in the areas marked by parallel white bars 
 the editors of the american journal of mathematics stated "the 'NN' puzzle for the last few weeks has been prominently before the american public, and may safely be said to have engaged the attention of nine out of ten persons of both sexes and all ages and conditions of the community 
 wellman and doyle (NNNN) provide a preliminary sketch of how a complex set of utility-independence relationships might be used to provide a structured model of a utility function, in much the same way that bayesian networks provide a structured model of joint probability distributions 
 what about the rest of thc agent's knowledge, such as its belief that wumpuses cause smells in adjacent squares? this is not a direct representation of a single percept, but a general rule-derived, perhaps, from perceptual experience but not identical to a statement of that experience 
 which is better-a reckless life of highs and lows, or a safe but humdrum existence? which is better-an economy where everyone lives in moderate poverty, or one in which some live in plenty while others are very poor? we will leave these questions as an exercise for the diligent reader 
 ) now, in chapter NN we pointed out that optimal policies in partially observable mdps are deterministic functions of the belief state rather than the current percept, so we would expect still better results by keeping track of the belief state using the filtering methods of chapter NN 
 he wrote, the capacity of the human mind for formulating and solving complex problems is very small compared with the size of the problems whose solution is required for objectively rational behavior in the real world-or even for a reasonabte approximation to such objective rationality 
 in part v, we have augmented the material on bayesian networks with new algorithms, such as variable elimination and markov chain monte carlo, and we have created a new chapter on uncertain temporal reasoning, covering hidden markov models, kalman filters, and dynamic bayesian networks 
 now that we have the full complement of actions, it is worthwhile to look at some of the examples of mutex relations and their causes: N inconsistent effects: remove (spare, trunk) is mutex with leaveovernight because one has the effect at (spare, ground) and the other has its negation 
 now we show that the gibbs sampler is in detailed balance with the true posterior: n(x)q(x x') = p(xje)p(xjjxi, e) = p(xi,rle)p(x:(xi,e) = p(xi (xi, e) (gle) p(zi (xi, e) (using the chain rule on the first term) = p(xilf, e) p(xi, kje) (using the chain rule backwards) = Nr(xN)q(x' N x) 
 such findings are not universally popular within the ga communit:y, but recent attempts within that community to understand population-based search as an approximate form of bayesian learning (see chapter NN) might help to close the gap between ithe field and its critics (pelikan et al 
 this is bad for at least three reasons: first, the hmm itself requires much more space; second, the huge transition matrix makes hmm inference much more expensive; and third, the problem of learning such a huge number of parameters makes the pure hmm model unsuitable for large problems 
 this seems to be a nice, elegant result, but why is it so important? the reason is that, except for a few special cases such as this, $filtering with continuous or hybrid (discrete and continuous) networks generates state distributions whose representation grows without bound over time 
 for any sentence a, variable v, and constant symbol k that does not appear elsewhere in the knowledge base, for example, from the sentence N N crown(x) a onhead (x, john) we can infer the sentence crown(cN) a onhead(cl, john) as long as cl does not appear elsewhere in the knowledge base 
 i - N-N) N l = c log - e NNN =(-lo\&--logo)- c j=N fin j=N NaN setting the derivatives to zero as usual, we obtain that is, the maximum-likelihood value of the mean is the sample average and the maximumlikelihood value of the standard deviation is the square root (of the sample variance 
 NN(b) shows the data in the new, three-dimensional space defined by the three features; the data are linearly separable in this space! this phenomeinon is actually fairly general: if data are mapped into a space of sufficiently high dimension, lhen they will always be linearly separable 
 the details vary slightly from one tool to another and so are best learned from the appropriate manual, but here we show how to build up a regular expression for prices in dollars, demonstrating common subexpressions: [o-NN matches any digit from N to N [o-NN+ matches one or more digits 
 for example, the agent is at [N,N] at time t if (a) it was there at t - N and either didn't move forward or tried but bumped into a wall; or (b) it was (at [N,N] facing down and moved forward; or (c) it was at [N,N] facing left and moved forward: the circuit for llll is shown in figure N 
 in logical agents, logicalagents which are the main subject of study in this chapter, inference must obey the fundamental requirement that when one asks a question of the knowledge base, the answer should follow from what has been told (or rather, tell^^) to the knowledge base previously 
 in practical terms, sma* might well be the best general-purpose algorithm for finding optimal solutions, particularly when the state space is a graph, step costs are not uniform, and node generation is expensive compared to the additional overhead of maintaining the open and closed lists 
 its rating of approximately NNNN was well above the novice level of NNNN, but it fell far short of the rating of NNNN or more that would have been needed to fulfill herb simon's NNNN prediction that a computer program would be world chess champion within NN years (simon and newell, NNNN) 
 the success of gps and subsequent programs as models of cognition led newelN and simon (NNNN) to formulate the famous physical physlcalsymbol symbol system hypothesis, which states that "a physical symbol system has the necessary and system sufficient means for general intelligent action 
 this claim has caused decades of controversy, spawning a vast literature including two books by the mathematician sir roger penrose (NNNN, NNNN) that repeat the claim with some fresh twists (such as the hypothesis that humans are different because their brains operate by quantum gravity) 
 about how many entries can you fit in a NNNmb in-memory table? will that be enough for the three minutes of search allocated for one move? how many table lookups can you do in the time it would take to do one evaluation? now suppose the transposition table is larger than can fit in memory 
 craik specified the three key steps of a knowledge-based agent: (N) the stimulus must be translated into an internal representation, (N) the representation is manipulated by cognitive processes to derive new internal representations, and (N) these are in turn retranslated back into action 
 this almost implies that the number of steps required to solve a conjunction of goals is the number of unsatisfied goals-almost but not quite, because (N) there may be two actions, each of which deletes the goal literal achieved by the other, and (N) some action may achieve multiple goals 
 unfortunately, this can be disastrous! for the majority of patients in general practice, the two most likely diagnoses are usually "there's nothing wrong with you" and "you have a bad cold," but if the third-most-likely diagnosis for a given patient is lung cancer, that's a serious matter 
 would this still give an admissible heuristic? the answer is no, because the solutions of the N-N-N-N subproblem and the N-N-N-N subproblem for a given state will almost certainly share some moves-it is unlikely that N-N-N-N can be moved into place without touching N-N-N-N, and vice versa 
 " our approach will be to adopt the foundation of propositional logic-a declarative, compositional semantics that is context-independent and unambiguous-and build a more expressive logic on that foundation, borrowing representational ideas from natural language while avoiding its drawbacks

 other than this change, everything else about the grammar remains the same, which is encouraging news; it suggests we are on the right track if we can so easily add a complication like the tense of verbs (although we have just scratched the surface of a complete grammar for time and tense) 
 that means that if you accept the notion that the brain prosthesis experiment shows that the replacement brain is conscious, then you should also believe that consciousness is maintained when the entire brain is replaced by a circuit that maps from inputs to outputs via a huge lookup table 
 utility functions NN N risk-averse risk-seeking certainty equivalent insurance premium risk-neutral value function ordinal utility function someone already $NN,NNN,NNN in debt might well accept a gamble on a fair coin with a gain of $NN,NNN,NNN for heads and a loss of $NN,NNN,NNN for tails 
 zenon pylyshyn (NNNN) has argued that cognition can best be understood through a computational model, not only in principle but also as a way of conducting research at present, and has specifically rebutted dreyfus's criticisms of the computational model of human cognition (pylyshyn, NNNN) 
 ) as a result, probabilistic approaches fell out of favor from roughly NNNN to NNNN, and a variety of alternatives to probability were tried for a variety of reasons: one common view is that probability theory is essentially numerical, whereas human judgmental reasoning is more "qualitative 
 direct evidence for the operation of reinforcement learning in animals has been provided by investigations into the foraging behavior of bees; therle is a clear neural correlate of the reward signal in the form of a large neuron mapping from the nectar intake sensors directly NNN chapter NN 
 it is obvious to a human that a good heuristic estimate for the cost of a state is the number of books that remain to be bought; unfortunately, this insight is not obvious to a problem-solving agent, because it sees the goal test only as a black box that returns true or false for each state 
 the construction of partially ordered plans (then called task networks) was pioneered by the noah planner (sacerdoti, NNNN, NNNN) and by tate's (NNNNb, NNNN) nonlin partial-order planning dominated the next NN years of research, yet for much of that time, the field was not widely understood 
 the primary advantage of using a dynamic bayesian network to represent the transition and sensor models is that it decomposes the state description into! a set of random variables, much as planning algorithms use logical representations to decompose the state space used by search algorithms 
 using improved methodology and theoretical frameworks, the field arrived at an understanding in which neural nets can now be compared with corresponding techniques from statistics, pattern recognition, and machine learning, and the most promising technique can be applied to each application 
 we have listed the medical-diagnosis task as single-agent because the disease process in a patient is not profitably modeled as an agent; but a medical-diagnosis system might also have to deal with recalcitrant patients and skeptical staff, so the environment could have a niultiagent aspect 
 for each possible assignment to the variables in s that satisfies all constraints on s, (a) remove from the domains of the remaining variables any values that are inconsistent with the assignment for s, and (b) if the remaining csp has a solution, return it together with the assignment for s 
 good current research in machine learning is published in the annual proceedings of the international conference on machine learning and the conference on neural information processing systems, in ma- (chine learning and the journal of machine learning research, and in mainstream aN journals 
 if monetary transactions are made "on one's behalf" by an intelligent agent, is one liable for the debts incurred? would it be possible for an intelligent agent to have assets itself and to perform electronic trades on its own behalf? so far, these questions do not seem to be well understood 
 the mathematical treatment of "preferred outcomesN ' or utility was first formalized by lkon walras (pronounced "valrasse") (NNNN- NNNN) and was improved by frank ramsey (NNN N) and later by john von neumann and oskar morgenstern in their book the theory of games and economic behavior (NNNN) 
 the wiiming rnachine was a parallel computer with NN ibm rstNNNN processors running the "software search" and NNN custom vlsl chess processors that performed move generation (including move ordering), the "hardware search" for the last few levels of the tree, and the evaluation of leaf nodes 
 this does not mean, of course, that computers use insight and understanding in performing these tasks-those are not part of behavior, and we address such questions elsewhere-but the point is that one's first guess about the mental processes required to produce a given behavior is often wrong 
 as usual, the first step is to write out the nested summation: e a m if we evaluate this expression from right to left, we notice something interesting: cm p(mja) is equal to N by definition! hence, there was no need to include it in the first place; the variable m is irrelevant to this query 
 but consider the following taylor series approximations for sin and tan: NN N NN N tan=z+++; sinr=x-+- N NNN NNNN ' an htn planner with subtask sharing could generate a more efficient solution, because it could choose to implement many steps of the sin computation with existing steps from tan 
 for example, if s contains solely the clause just given, then hs(s) is the infinite set of clauses {+(a, f(a, a)) v lq(aN a) v r(a, b), +(b, f(b, a)) v lq(b, a) v r(b, b), lp(f(a, a), f(f(a, a), a)) v lq(f(a, ap, a) v r(f(aN a), b), lp(f(a, h), f(f(a, b), a)) v lq(f(a, b), a) v r(f(a, b), b), 
 in addition to showing that any csp with hypertree width w can be solved in time o(nw+' log n), they also showed that hypertree width subsumes all previously defined measures of "width" in the sense that there are cases where the hypertree width is bounded and the other measures are unbounded 
 instead, he maintains that the question is just as ill-defined as asking, "can machines think?" besides, why should we insist on a higher standard for machines than we do for humans? after all, in ordinary life we never have any direct evidence about the internal mental states of other humans 
 it seems unarguably true that populations having greater familiarity with some aspects of the world develop much more detailed vocabularies-for example, field entomologists divide what most of us call beetles into hundreds of thousands of species and are personally familiar with many of these 
 N time, schedules, and resources -- the strips representation talks about what actions do, but, because the representation is based on situation calculus, it cannot talk about how long an action takes or even about when an action occurs, except to say that it is before or after another action 
 on the other hand, if we insist that only completely free cells may be used, the planner will be incomplete, because it might be the case that the only paths to the goal may go through mixed cells-especially if the cell size is comparable to that of the passageways and clearances in the space 
 the policy improvement step is obviously straightforward, but how do we implement the policy-evaluation routine? it turns out that doing so is much simpler than solving the standard bellman equations (which is what value iteration does), because the action in each state is fixed by the policy 
 whereas chapter NN was concerned with one-shot or episodic decision problems, in which the utility of each action's outcome was well known, we will be concerned here with sequential sequential decision problems decision problems, in which the agent's utility depends on a sequence of decisions 
 but if there is no friendly teacher providing examples, what can the agent do? by trying random moves, the agent can eventually build a predictive model of its environment: what the board will be like after it makes a given move and even how the opponent is likely to reply in a given situation 
 decision theory decision theory, which combines probability theory with utility theory, provides a formal and complete framework for decisions (economic or otherwise) made under uncertaintythat is, in cases where probabilistic descriptions appropriately capture the decision-maker's environment 
 government's classified echelon system "consists of a network of listening posts, antenna fields, and radar stations; the system is backed by computers that use language translation, speech recognition, and keyword searching to automatically sift through telephone, email, fax, and telex traffi 
 making complex decisions lurking beneath our choice of infinite horizons is a problem: if the environment does not contain a terminal state, or if the agent never reaches one, then all environment histories will be infinitely long, and utilities with additive rewards will generally be infinite 
 norbert wiener, a pioneer of cybernetics and control theory (wiener, NNNN), worked with mcculloch and pitts and influenced a number of young researchers including marvin minsky, who may have been the first to develop a working neural network in hardware in NNNN (see minsky and papert, NNNN, pp

 the doctor who derived the diagnostic probability p(mNs) directly from statistical observation of patients before the epidemic will have no idea how to update the value, but the doctor who computes p(mls) from the other three values will see that p(mNs) should go up proportionately with p(NNN) 
 vision science: photons to phenomenology by stephen palmer (NNNN) provides the best comprehensive treatment of human vision; the books eye, brain and vision by david hubel (NNNN) and perception by irvin rock (NNNN) are short introductions centered on neurophysiology and perception respectively 
 choosing hmap to maximize p(d(h,) p(h,) is equivalent to minimizing - log, p(d(h,) - logN p(h,) - using the connection between information encoding and probability that we introduced in chapter NN, we see that the - logz p(h,) term equals the number of bits required to specify the hypothesis h, 
 early vision operations are characterized by their local nature (they can be carried out in one part of the image without regard for anything more than a few pixels away) and by their lack of knowledge: we can smooth images and detect edges without having any idea what objects are in the images 
 for example, if white has one move aN that can be answered by black with bl and an unrelated move aN on the other side of the board that can be answered by bN, then the sequences [al, bl , aN , bN] and [al , bN, az, bl] both end up in the same position (as do the permutations beginning with aN) 
 for example, the following rule is used to recognize a ketone (c=o) subgroup (which weighs NN): if there are two peaks at xi and NN such that (a) xi + NN = m + NN (m is the mass of the whole molecule); (b) zl - NN is a high peak; (c) xz - NN is a high peak; (d) at least one of xi and xz is high

 the text by pearl (NNNN) was the first in aN to cover probability and utility theory in depth; its exposition of practical methods for reasoning and decision making under uncertainty was probably the single biggest factor in the rapid shift towards utility-based agents in the NNNNs (see part v) 
 wilh these parameters, the likelihood of seeing, say, a cherry candy in a green wrapper can be (obtained from the standard semantics for bayesian networks (page NNN): p(fNavor = cherry, wrapper = greenN hs,el,eN) = p(fNavor = cherryN he,e,,bz) p( wrapper = green i flavor = cherry, he,ol eN) = N 
 for example, we can ask the query append (a, b , [ N,N i ) : what two lists can be appended to give [ N,N N ? we get back the solutions the execution of prolog programs is done via depth-first backward chaining, where clauses are tried in the order in which they are written in the knowledge base 
 it should also spend that split second thinlung about the most important questions, such as whether the lanes to the left and right are clear and whether there is a large truck close behind, rather than worrying about wear and tear on the tires or where to pick up the real-time ai next passenger 
 N was this: how can one be sure that one's learning algorithm has produced a theory that will correctly predict the future? in formal terms, how do we know that the hypothesis h is close to the target function f if we don't know what f is? these questions have been pondered for several centuries 
 pearl (NNNN) has presented convincing arguments to the contrary, showing that there are in fact many cases where causal network causality can be ascertained and developing the causal network formalism to express causes and the effects of intervention as well as ordinary conditional probabilities 
 the advice taker thus embodied the central principles of knowledge representation and reasoning: that it is useful to have a formal, explicit representation of the world and of the way an agent's actions affect the world and to be able to manipulate these representations with deductive processes 
 can you think of a new set of propositional variables to define states of the vacuum world, such that suck has an unconditional description? write out the descriptions of suck, left, and right, using your propositions, and demonstrate that they suffice to describe all possible states of the world 
 in other words, the suggestion is to alter minimax or alpha-beta in two ways: the utility function is replaced by a heuristic evaluation function eval, which gives an estimate of the position's cutoff test utility, and the terminal test is replaced by a cutoff test that decides when to apply eval 
 results for td learning have been progressively strengthened for the case of linear function approximators (sutton, NNNN; dayan, NNNN; tsitsiklis and van roy, NNNN), but several examples of divergence have been presented for nonlinear functions (see tsitsiklis and van roy, NNNN, for a discussion) 
 the fredkin prize, established in NNNN, offered $NNNN to the first program to achieve a master rating, $NN,NNN to the first program to achieve a uscf (united states chess federation) rating of NNNN (near the grandmaster level), and $NNN,NNN for the first program to defeat the human world champion

 cylinder while computer vision research on object recognition largely focused on issues arising from the projection of three-dimensional objects onto two-dimensional images, there was a parallel tradition in the pattern recognition community that viewed the problem as one of pattern classification 
 he cites a speech by professor geoffrey jefferson (NNNN): not until a machine could write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain-that is, not only write it but know that it had written it 
 logic programming logic programming is a technology that comes fairly close to embodying the declarative ideal described in chapter N: that systems should be constructed by expressing knowledge in a formal language and that problems should be solved by running inference processes on that knowledge

 the second key step is to notice that the residualN term has to be a quadratic in xi; in fact, after simplificatioa, we obtain that is, the one-step predicted distribution is a gaussian with the same mean po and a variance equal to the sum of the original variance a: and the tiransition variance NN 
 ) critical path the critical path is that path whose total duration is longest; the path is "critical" because it determines the duration of the entire plan-shortening other paths doesn't shorten the plan as a whole, but delaying the start of any action on the critical path slows down the whole plan 
 alas, if rnax-j%ps is infinity and the sentence is unsatisfiable, then the algorithm never terminates! what this suggests is that local-search algorithms such as walksat are most useful when we expect a solution to exist-for example, the problenls discussed in chapters N and N usually have solutions 
 whichever kind of representation the agent uses, ifthe axioms correctly and completely describe the way the world works and the way that percepts are produced, then any complete logical inference procedure will infer the strongest possible description of the world state, given the available percepts 
 you can't tell the difference with "go," but observe that the correct form of a command is "be good!"

 , deciding where to grasp an object), but its most significant role is in object recognition, where geometric shape along with color and texture provide the most significant cues to enable us to identify objects, classify what is in the image as an example of some class one has seen before, and so on 
 clearly, if the agent knew it was in (N,N), it would move right; if it knew it was in (N,N), it would move up; but since it could be anywhere, what should it do? one possible answer is that the agent should first act so as to reduce its uncertainty, and only then should it try heading for the +N exit 
 for large resource-limited problems with integer values-such as logistical problems involving moving thousands of people in hundreds of vehicles-it is usually not possible to represent the domain of each variable as a large set of integers and gradually reduce that set by consistency checking methods 
 if we let st be the state the agent is in after executing t for t steps (note that st is a random variable), then we have given this definition, the true utility of a state, which we write as u(s), is just ut* (s)-that is, the expected sum of discounted rewards if the agent executes an optimal policy 
 in its most general form, mcmc is a powerful method for computing with probability models and many variants have been developed, including the simulated annealing algorithm presented in chapter N, the stochastic satisfiability algorithms in chapter N, and the metropolis-hastings sampler in chapter NN

 the fundamental result in this area is due to forestier and varaiya (NNNN), who proved that lower-level behaviors of arbitrary complexity can be treated just like primitlive actions (albeit ones that can take varying amounts of time) from the point of view of the higher-level behavior that invokes them 
 the gambler must choose which lever to play on each successive coin-the one that has paid off best, or maybe one that has not been tried? the n-armed bandit problem is a formal model for real problems in many vitally important areas, such as deciding on the annual budget for aN research and development 
 the probability of a disjunction is given by this rule is easily remembered by noting that the cases where a holds, together with the cases where b holds, certainly cover all the cases where a v b holds; but summing the two sets of cases counts their intersection twice, so we need to subtract y (a a N)

 judea pearl developed the message-passing method for carrying out inference in f,ree networks (pearl, NNNNa) and polytree networks (kim and pearl, NNNN) and explained the importance of constructing causal rather than diagnostic probability models, in contrast to the certainty-factor systems then in vogue 
 now, even if the structure describes the true causal nature of the domain, statistical fluctuations in the data set mean that the equation will never be satisfied exactly, so we need to perform a suitable statistical test to see if there is sufficient evidence that the independence hypothesis is violated 
 we will consider two kinds of execution monitoring: a simple, but weak form called action monitoring, whereby the agent checks the environment to verify that the next action will work, and a more complex but more effective form called plan monitoring, in which the agent verifies the entire remaining plan 
 bibliographical and historical notes the use of heuristic information in problem solving appears in an early paper by simon and newelN (NNNN), but the phrase "heuristic search" and the use of heuristic functions that estimate the distance to the goal came somewhat later (newell and ernst, NNNN; lin, NNNN) 
 for example, the denotation of both "clark" and "superman" is the object referred to by the constant symbol manofsteel, and the name of that object within the knowledge base could be either "superman", "clark", or some other constant, such as "xll": den("cNark") = manofsteel a den("superman") = manofsteel 
 for instance, in dynamic logic, if a is the name of a program, then "[alp" means "p would be true in all world states resulting from executing program a in the current world state", and "(a)pv means " p would be true in at least one world state resulting from executing program a in the current world state 
 having stated these axioms, can we prove that our little plan achieves the goal? unl'ortunately not! at first, everything works fine; go([l, i], [i, NN) is indeed possible in so and the effect axiom for go allows us to conclude that the agent reaches [i,%]: at(agent, [i, NN, result(go([l, NN,[N?

 what is unclear is the direction of causality-do skiers become aware of the distinctions only by learning the words, or do the distinctions emerge from individual experience and become matched with the labels current in the community? this question is especially important in the study of child development 
 wlhat this means in practice is that the fraction of samples that remain reasonably close to the actual series of events drops exponentially with t, the length of the observation sequence; in other words, to maintain a given level of accuracy, we need to increase the number of samples exponentially with t 
 yes' rule and its use on page NNN, we defined the product rule and pointed out that it can be written in two forms because of the commutativity of conjunction: equating the two right-hand sides and dividing by p(a), we get bayes rule this equation is known as bayes' rule (also bayes' law or bayes' therem) 
 "surely," one might say, "this is not a real environment, is it?" in fact, what matters is not the distinction between "real" and "artificial" environments, but the complexity of the relationship among the behavior of the agent, the percept sequence generated by the environment, and the performance measure 
 also, they are more robust (because they can accept any string, albeit with a low probability), they reflect the fact that not NNN% of speakers agree on which sentences are actually part of a language, and they can be used for disambiguation: probability can be used to choose the most likely interpretation 
 it is traditional in decision analysis to talk about two decisionmaker roles: the decision maker states preferences between outcomes, and the decision analyst decision analyst enumerates the possible actions and outcomes and elicits preferences from the decision maker to determine the best course of action 
 now it is possible to extend the notation to make it equivalent to first-order logic-as in peirceN s existential graphs or hendrix's (NNNN) partitioned semantic networks-but doing so negates one of the main advantages of semantic networks, which is the simplicity and transparency of the inference processes 
 pose queries to the inference procedure what combinations of inputs would cause the first output of cl (the sum bit) to be N and the second output of cN (the carry bit) to be l? the answers are substitutions for the variables il, iN, and iN such that the resulting sentence is entailed by the knowledge base 
 the following NN-word sequence was generated at random from a unigram model of the words in this book: logical are as are confusion a may right tries agent goal the was diesel more object then information-gathering search is a bigram model assigns a probability p(w(w-) to each word, given the previous word 
 the reader might wish to consult appendix a for some of the mathematical properties of gaussian distributions; for our immediate purposes, multivariate gaussian the most important is that a multivariate gaussian distribution for d variables is specified by a d-element mean p and a d x d covariance matrix e

 describing actions in situation calculus in the simplest version of situation calculus, each action is described by two axioms: a possipossibilityaxiom bility axiom that says when it is possible to execute the action, and an effect axiom that says effect axiom what happens when a possible action is executed 
 in particular, we should be able to ask, "what was it like during the operation? do you remember the pointed stick?the subject must have accurate memories of the actual nature of his or her conscious experiences, including the qualia, despite the fact that, according to searle there were no such experiences 
 thus, by asserting the universally quantified sentence, which is equivalent to asserting a whole list of individual implications, we end up asserting the conclusion of the rule just for those objects for whom the premise is true and saying nothing at all about those individuals for whom the premise is false 
 now we need a rule that says "an np with semantics obj followed by a vp with semantics reN yields a sentence whose semantics is the result of applying reN to obj:" the rule tells us that the semantic interpretation of "john loves mary" is (ax loves(x, mary)) (john) , which is equivalent to loves (john, mary) 
 two kinds of agents can be built on the basis of' propositional logic: inference-based agents use inference algorithms to keep track of the world and deduce hidden properties, whereas circuit-based agents represent propositions as bits in registers and update them using signal propagation in logical circuits 
 although kalman filtering was well-known as a localization method in control theory for decades, the general probabilistic formulation of the localization problem did not appear in the aN literature until much later, through the work of tom dean and colleagues (NNNN, NNNN) markov and simmons and koenig (NNNN) 
 although the "intentional stance" viewpoint (dennett, NNNN) could be interpreted as functionalist, it should probably instead be regarded as a form of eliminative materialism, in that taking the "intentional stance" is not supposed to reflect any objective property of the agent toward whom the stance is taken 
 dx+o the density function must be nonnegative for all x and must have we can also define a cumulative probability density function f (x), which is the probability of a random variable being less than x: note that the probability density function has units, whereas the discrete probability function is unitless 
 for an english sentence of length n that is aligned to a french sentence of length m, look at each french word in the sentence (at position i) and at each english word in the sentence (at position j) that is a likely word choice for the french word, and consider that as evidence for pi ofset = i - j li, n, m) 
 the complexity of arc consistency checking can be analyzed as follows: a binary csp has at most N(nN) arcs; each arc (xk, xi) can be inserted on the agenda only d times, because xi has at most d values to delete; checking consistency of an arc can be done in N(dN) time; so the total worst-case time is N(nNdN) 
 in the NNNNs, several statisticians, including box (NNNN) and friedman (NNNN), used evolutionary techniques for optimization evolution strategies problems, but it wasn't until rechenberg (NNNN, NNNN) introduced evolution strategies to solve optimization problems for airfoils that the approach gained popularity 
 one such mechanism is to pay each player a payoff pi equal to the length of the shortest path that does not contain the ith edge minus the length of the shortest path (as computed by a search algorithm) where the cost of the ith edge is assumed to be N: pi = length(^^^^ with ci = co) - length(path with ci = N) 
 this gives rise to two problems: first, given a complete decision tree, how should one classify an object that is missing one of the test attributes? second, how should one modify the information gain formula when some examples have unknown values for the attribute? these questions are addressed in exercise NN 
 for example, a robot designed to inspect parts as they come by on a conveyor belt can make use of a number of simplifying assumptions: that the lighting is always just so, that the only thing on the conveyer belt will be parts of a kind that it knows about, and that there are only two actions (accept or reject) 
 it was developed at stanford, where ed feigenbaum (a former student of herbert simon), bruce buchanan (a philosopher turned computer scientist), and joshua lederberg (a nobel laureate geneticist) teamed up to solve the problem of inferring molecular structure from the information provided by a mass spectrometer 
 N consider the sentence "someone walked slowly to the supermarket" and the following lexicon: pronoun -+ someone v -+ walked adv -+ slowly prep + to det -+ the noun -t supermarket which of the following three grammars, combined with the lexicon, generates the given sentence? show the corresponding parse tree(s) 
 N) that n that is, any probability distribution on a single variable must sum to it is also true that any joint probability distribution on any set of variables must sum to N: this can be seen simply by creating a single megavariable whose domain is the cross product of the domains of the the original variables 
 that is, more interesting is the possibility of constructing a plan to get the gold, which is achieved by answering the query "what sequence of actions results in the gold being at [N,N]?" N seq at (gi, [i, NN, result (seq , so)) let us see what has to go into the knowledge base for these queries to be answered 
 the basic idea is an example of dynamic programming: every time we analyze a substring, store the results so we won't have to re-analyze it later: for example, once we discover that "the students in section N of computer science NNN" is an np, we can record chart that result in a data structure known as a chart 
 what reasons does the viewer have to conclude that one is closer than the other? in which agents are endowed with physical eflectors with which to do rnischiet robots effector sensor manipulator mobile robot uav auv planetary rover robots are physical agents that perform tasks by manipulating the physical world 
 why, then, are aN and control theory two different fields, especially given the close connections among their founders? the answer lies in the close coupling between the mathematical techniques that were familiar to the participants and the corresponding sets of problems that were encompassed in each world view 
 we say that the subtree below pruning timisoara is pruned; because hsld is admissible, the algorithm can safely ignore this subtree * completeness requires that there be only finitely many nodes with cost less than or equal to c*, a condition that is true if all step costs exceed some finite t and if b is finite 
 by NNNN, almost as soon as computers became programmable, chess had been tackled by konrad zuse (the inventor of the first programmable computer and the first programming language), by claude shannon (the inventor of information theory), by norbert wiener (the creator of modern control theory), and by alan turing 
 if the supposed "nonfunctional" aspects of the real neurons then result in functionally different behavior from that observed with artificial neurons still in place, then we have a simple reductio ad absurdurn, because that would mean that the artificial neurons are not functionally equivalent to the real neurons

 examine each corpus and decide what features appear to be useful for classification: unigram words? bigrams? message lengtlh, sender, time of arrival? then train a classification algorithm (decision tree, naive bayes, or some other algorithm of your choosing) on a training set and report its accuracy on a test set 
 N function reflex-agent-with-state(c) returns an action static: state, a description of the current world state rules, a set of condition-action rules action, the most recent action, initially none state +- update-state(, actiolN, percept) rule +- ru-mtch(state, rules) action t rule-action[] return action figure N 
 we have already seen that general-purpose intelligence requires some reflex capability and some deliberative capability, a variety of forms of knowledge and decision making, learning and compilation mechanisms for all of those forms, methods for controlling reasoning, and a large store of domain-specific knowledge 
 applying the semantics, we see that the sentence says that at least one of the following assertions is true: richard the lionheart is a crown N richard the lionheart is on john's head; king john is a crown + king john is on john's head; richard's left leg is a crown + richard's left leg is on john's head; and so on 
 second, we need some information about how the agent's own actions affect the world-for example, that when the agent turns the steering wheel clockwise, the car turns to the right or that after driving for five minutes northbound on the freeway one is usually about five miles north of where one was five minutes ago 
 some rules do change; the lexical rule for "a" is and the rule for combining an article with a noun is this says that the semantics of the np is a quantified term, with a quantifier specified by the article, with a new variable x, and with a proposition formed by applying the semantics of the noun to the variable x 
 then as soon as we get an action b such that all the actions that come immediately before b have es values assigned, we set es(b) to be the maximum of the earliest finish times of those immediately preceding actions, where the earliest finish time of an action is defined as the earliest start time plus the duration 
 for example, we have determining that there is a pit in a square is more difficult-there must be a breeze in an adjacent square that cannot be accounted for by another pit: while the circuits for determining the presence or absence of pits are somewhat hairy, they have only a constant number of gates for each square 
 he explicitly conceived of animals as automata, and he anticipated the turing test, writing "it is not conceivable [that a machine] should produce different arrangements of words so as to give an appropriately meaningful answer to whatever is said in its presence, as even the dullest of men can do" (descartes, NNNN) 
 the cfg rule s + np vp is shorthand for the definite clause np(sl) a vp(sN) + s(sl + sN) here sl +sN denotes the concatenation of two strings, so this lule says that if the string sl is an np and the string sN is a vp, then their concatenation is an :N', which is exactly how we were already interpreting the cfg rule 
 as we showed in chapter N, rational behavior can be generated in any number of ways, some of which are more efficient than explicit we can account for the enjoyment of gambling by encoding gambling events into the state description; for example, "have $NN and gambled" could be preferred to "have $NN and didn't gamble 
 in chapter NN, we saw that kalman filters, hmms, and dynamic bayes nets can represent the transition and sensor models of a partially observable environment, and we described both exact and approximate algorithms for updating the belief state-the posterior probability distribution over the environment state variables 
 ) when discrete variables iire added (provided that no discrete variable is a child of a continuous variable), the network defines conditional gaussian a conditional gaussian, or cg, distribution: given any assignment to the discrete variables, the distribution over the continuous variables is a multitvariate gaussian 
 a bigram model of this book generates the following random sequence: planning purely diagnostic expert systems are very similar computational approach would be represented compactly using tjic tac toe a predicate in general, an n-gram model conditions on the previous n - N words, assigning a probability for p(wjw-(,_) 
 the simplest case is when there is no metonymy at all-the literal object j: and the metonymic object m are identical: for the chrysler example, a reasonable generalization is that an organization can be used to stand for a spokesperson of that organization: v m, x x e organizations a spokesperson(m, x) metonymy (m, x) 
 what will the first statistician (an avid bayesian) do? how about the second statistician, who always uses the maximum likelihood hypothesis? the doctor does some research and discovers that disease b actually comes in two versions, dextro-b and levo-b, which are equally likely and equally treatable by the anti-b drug 
 conjunctive normal form for first-order logic as in the propositional case, first-order resolution requires that sentences be in conjunctive normal form (cnf)-that is, a conjunction of clauses, where each clause is a disjilnction of literahN literals can contain variables, which are assumed to be universally quantified 
 for example, does the wunnpus knowledge base need to be able to choose actions or is it required to answer questions only about the contents of the environment? will the sensor facts include the current location? the task will determine what knowledge must be represented in order to connect problem instances to answers 
 implementing an information-gathering agent a sensible agent should ask questions of the user in a reasonable order, should avoid aslung questions that are irrelevant, should take into account the importance of each piece of information in relation to its cost, and should stop asking qluestions when that is appropriate

 so, while an inference process operates on "syntaxw --internal physical configurations such as bits in registers or patterns of electrical blips in brains-the process corresponds to the real-world relationship whereby some aspect of the real world is the caseN by virtue of other aspects of the real world being the case 
 altogether, the sentence has four parses:N [s: [s: [np: fall leaves] fall] and [s: [np: spring leaves] spring] ; [s: [s: [np: fall leaves] fall] and [s: spring [vp: leaves spring]] ; [s: [s: fall [ vp: leaves fall]] and [s: [np: spring leaves] spring] ; [s: [s: fall [vp: leaves fall]] and [s: spring [vp: leaves spring]]

 an mdp is defined by the following three components: initial state: so transition model: t(s, a, s') reward unction:' r(s) the next question is, what does a solution to the problem look like? we have seen that any fixed action sequence won't solve the problem, because the agent might end up in a state other than the goal 
 NN implement two versions of the successor function for the N-puzzle: one that generates all the successors at once by copying and editing the N-puzzle data structure, and one that generates one new successor each time it is called and works by modifying the parent state directly (and undoing the modifications as needed) 
 probabilistic language models NNN function viterbi-segmentation(x, p) returns best words and their probabilities inputs: text, a string of characters with spaces removed p, a unigram probability distribution over worals n +- length( text) words + empty vector of length n + N best t vector of length n + N, initially all N 
 to choose between them the agents can either guess or communicate, which can be done either by establishing a convention that orders the solutions before the game begins or by negotiating to reach a mutually beneficial solution during the game (which would mean including communicative actions as part of a multimove game) 
 using our notation, the corresponding conditional independercce assertion states that, for all t, hence, in a first-order markov process, the laws describing how the state evolves over time are contained entirely within the conditional distribution p(xt (xt-l), which we call the transition model for first-order processes 
 what is the weather sequence most likely to explain this? does the absence of the umbrella on day N mean that it wasn't raining, or did the director forget to bring it? if it didn't rain on day N, perhaps (because weather tends to persist) it didn't rain on day N either, but the director brought the umbrella just in case 
 when trying to design an agent that learns a certain capability, the first question is not "how am i going to get it to learn this?" but "what kind of performance element will my agent need to do this once it has learned how?'given an agent design, learning mechanisms can be constructed to improve every part of the agent 
 a hint that this should be possible is that the simple approach is o(aet); why should it depend on the number of actions, a, when we know exactly which one action is executed at each time step? to see how to improve matters, we first look at the format of the frame axioms: poss(a, s) j f,(result(a, s)) ++ (a = aN v a = aN 
 an alternative to the probit logit distribution model is the logit distribution, which uses the sigmoid function to produce a soft threshold: slgmold function N p(buys / cost =c) = N + e(-a+) ' it follows that inference in linear gaussian networks takes only N(nN) time in the worst case, regardless of the network topology 
 it might seem obvious that at some level humans manipulate symbols-in fact, terrence deacon's book the symbolic species (NNNN) suggests that this is the dejining characteristic of humans, but the most ardent connectionists questioned whether symbol manipulation had any real explanatory role in detailed models of cognition 
 some of the planning algorithms in chapter NN use hierarchical representations and first-order representations to handle problems of this scale; on the other hand, the algorithms given in chapter NN for decision making under uncertainty are essentially using the same ideas as the state-based search algorithms of chapter N 
 while the details of the weight adjustments are not so important, adaboost does have a very weak learning important property: if the input learning algorithm l is a weak learning algorithm-which means that l always returns a hypothesis with weighted error on the training set that is slightly better than random guessing (i

 about how many evaluations could you do in the time it takes to do one disk seek with standard disk hardware? N logical agents in which we design agents that can form representations of the would, use a process of inference to derive new representations about the world, and use these new representations to deduce what to do 
 in sum, many of the issues dreyfus has focused on-background commonsense knowledge, the qualification problem, uncertainty, learning, compiled forms of decision making, the importance of considering situated agents rather than disembodied inference engines-have by now been incorporated into standard intelligent agent design 
 lo generates good english sentences such as the following: john is in the pit the wumpus that stinks is in N N mary is in boston and john stinks overgeneration unfortunately, the grammar overgenerates: that is, it generates sentences that are not grarnmatical, such as "me go boston" and "i smell pit gold wumpus nothing east 
 warplan is also notable in that it was the first planner to be written in a logic programming language (prolog) and is one of the best examples of the remarkable economy that can sometimes be gained by using logic programming: warplan is only NNN lines of code, a small fraction of the size of comparable planners of the time 
 as a rule of thumb, good internal representations have three properties: they contain enough information for the robot to make the right decisions, they are structured so that they can be updated efficiently, and they are natural in the sense that internal variables correspond to natural state variables in the physical world 
 hence, the program behaves totally differently if we make a change in the scale of some evaluation values! it turns out that, to avoid this sensitivity, the evaluaiion function must be a positive linear transformation of the probability of winning from a polsition (or, more generally, of the expected utility of the position) 
 these dimensions determine, to a large extent, the appropriate agent design and the performance measure healthy patient, minimize costs, lawsuits correct image categorization percentage of parts in correct bins maximize purity, yield, safety maximize student's score on test examples of agent types and their peas descriptions 
 computing the backward message incrementally is more tricky, because there is no simple relationship between the old backward message bt-d+pt and the new backward message bt-d+N:t+l instead, vve will examine the relationship between the old backward message bt-d+pt and the backward message at the front of the sequence, bt+lzt 
 having obtained a utility function u that is optimal for the learned ]model, the agent can extract an optimal action by one-step look-ahead to maximize the expected utility; alternatively, if it uses policy iteration, the optimal policy is already available, so it should simply execute the action the optimal policy recommends 
 inductive learning NN N eraN examples: linear weighted polynomials for utility functions in game-playing programs; propositional and first-order logical sentences for all of the cornponents in a logical agent; and probabilistic descriptions such as bayesian networks for the inferential components of a decision-theoretic agent 
 the nature of explanation, by bartlett's student and successor kenneth craik (NNNN), forcefully reestablished the legitimacy of such "mental" terms as beliefs and goals, arguing that they are just as scientific as, say, using pressure and temperature to talk about gases, despite their being made of molecules that have neither 
 we have already worked out how to learn bayes nets, but there is one complication: in bayes nets, each parameter is distinct; in a hidden markov model, on the other hand, the individual transition probabilities from state i to state j at time t, oijt = p(xt+l = jlxt = i), are repeated across time-that is, oijt = oij for all t 
 although the others had ideas and in some cases programs for particular applications such as checkers, newelN and simon already had a reasoning program, the logic theorist (lt), about which simon claimed, "we have invented a computer program capable of thinking non-numerically, and thereby solved the venerable mind-body problem 
 for example, systematic biology aims to provide a taxonomy of all living and extinct species; library science has developed a taxonomy of all fields of knowledge, encoded as the dewey decimal system; and tax authorities and other government departments have developed extensive taxoriornies of occupations and commercial products 
 how can dynamic situations like these be modeled? states and observations the basic approach we will adopt is similar to the idea underlying situation calculus, as described in chapter NN: the process of change can be viewed as a series of snapshots, each time slice of which describes the state of the world at a particular time 
 inference in first-order logic function fol-fc-ask(kb, a) returns a substitution or false inputs: kb, the knowledge base, a set of first-order definite clauses a, the query, an atomic sentence local variables: new, the new sentences inferred on each iteration repeat until new is empty new + {) for each sentence r in kb do (pl a 
 it is impossible to tell whether this statement is correct without looking at the rest of the program to see whether, for example, off set is used to refer to the current position, or to one beyond the current position, or whether the value of posi tion is changed by another statement and so off set should also be changed again 
 one popular representation is the softmax function: softmax becomes nearly deterministic if one action is much better than the others, but it always gives a differentiable function of N; hence, the value of the policy (which depends in a continuous fashion on the action selection probabilities) is a differentiable function of N 
 rina dechter (NNNN) shows how the variable elimination ide,a is essentially identical to monserial dynamic programming (bertele and brioschi, NNNN), an algorithmic approach that can be applied to solve a range of inference problems in bayesian networks-for example, finding the most probable explanation for a set of observations 
 the first tree shows the proof for the original problem instance, from which we can derive i arithmeticunknown(x) i arithmetic unknown(z) =+ simplify(N x (N + z), z) simplify(x x cy+z),w) the second shows the proof for a problem instance with all constants replaced by variables, from which we can derive a variety of other rules 
 this makes it a little difficult, however, to pose questions such as "what are all the possible values of the signals at the output terminals of circuit cN ?" we will therefore introduce as objects two "signal values" N and N, and a function signal that takes a terminal as argument and denotes the signal value for that terminal 
 an environment might be partially observable because of noisy and inaccurate sensors or because parts of the state are simplly missing from the sensor data-for example, a vacuum agent with only a local dirt sensor cannot tell whether there is dirt in other squares, and an automated taxi cannot see what other drivers are thinking 
 for example, deciding whether a bipartite graph has a perfect matching can be done in time o(ve) (where the graph has v vertices and e edges), but the counting problem "how many perfect matches does this bipartite graph have" is #p-complete, meaning that it is hard as any problem in #p and thus at least as hard as any np problem 
 for example, if one state generates several good successors and the other k - N states all generate bad successors, then the effect is that the first state says to the others, "come over here, the grass is greener!" the algorithm quickly abandons unfruitful searches and moves its resources to where the most progress is being made 
 from the lifting lemma, it is easy to derive a similar statement about any sequence of applications of the resolution rule: for any clause c' in the resolution closure of st there is a clause c in the resolution closure of s, such that c' is a ground instance of c and the derivation of c is the same length as the derivation of c'

 this inference process can be captured as a single inference rule that we call generalgeneraponens lized ized modus ponens: for atomic sentences p,, p,', and q, where there is a substitution N such that suesr(q,pil) = suesr(b,p,), for all i, there are n + N premises to this rule: the n atomic sentences pi' and the one implication 
 first, note that, in order for the external behavior to remain the same while the subject gradually becomes unconscious, it must be the case that the subject's volition is removed instantaneously and totally; otherwise the shrinking of awareness would be reflected in external behavior-"help, i'm shrinking!" or words to that effect 
 part vii, communicating, perceiving, and acting, describes ways in which an intelligent agent can perceive its environment so as to know what is going on, whether by vision, touch, hearing, or understanding language, and ways in which it can turn its plans into real actions, either as robot motion or as natural language utterances 
 that is, search for a subset of pixels that you can classify as a face, and if you succeed, you have found a group! purely top-down approaches have high computational complexity, because one needs to examine image windows of different sizes, and at different locations, as well as compare them to all the different object hypotheses

 whereas the identification-in-the-limit approach concentrates on eventual convergence, ckolmogorov omplexity the study of kolmogorov complexity or algorithmic ccomplexity, developed indelpendently by solomonoff (NNNN) and kolmogorov (NNNN), attempts to provide a formal definition for the notion of siinplicity used in ockham's razor 
 herbert simon (N NN N- NNNN), the pioneering aN researcher, won the nobel prize in economics in NNNN for his early satisficing work showing that models based on satisficing-making decisions that are "good enough," rather than laboriously calculating an optimal decision-gave a better description of actual human behavior (simon, NNNN) 
 how quickly does it converge in practice and how well does it scale? in which we try to interpret the present, understand the past, and perhaps predict the future, even when very little is crystal clear: i agents in uncertain environments must be able to keep track of the current state of the environment, just as logical agents must 
 so we need three basic axioms, and then one for each predicate and function: vx x=x 'dx,y x=y + y=x vx,y,z x=yay=z + x=z vx,y x=y =+ (pN(x) ++ pN(y)) x,y x=y + (pN(x) * p(y)) given these sentences, a standard inference procedure such as resolution can perform tasks requiring equality reasoning, such as solving mathematical equations 
 there is a recognition that machine learning should not be isolated from information theory, that uncertain reasoning should not be isolated from stochastic modeling, that search should not be isolated from classical optimization and control, and that automated reasoning should not be isolated from formal methods and static analysis 
 william of ockham (NNNN-NNNN), the most influential philosopher of his century and a major contributer to medieval epistemology, logic, and metaphysics, is credited with a statement called "ockham's razor"-in latin, entia non sunt multiplicands praeter necessitatem, and in english, "entities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity 
 given the logical definitions from the preceding paragraphs and suitable knowledge bases of product categories and naming conventions, are we ready to apply an inference algorithm to obtain a set of relevant offers for our query? not quite! the missing element is the getpage(urN) function, which refers to the html page at a given url 
 max's algorithm will also never decide to gather information (or provide information to a partner), because within each deal there's no need to do so; yet in games such as bridge, it is often a good idea to play a card that will help one discover things about one's opponent's cards or that will tell one's partner about one's own cards 
 the first unifier gives knows(john, z) as the result of unification, whereas the second gives knows (john, john), the second result could be obtained from the first by an additional substitution {z/ john); we say that the first unifier is more general than the second, because it places fewer restrictions on the values of the variables 
 the key benefit of hierarchical structure is that, at each level of the hierarchy, a computational task, military mission, or administrative function is reduced to a small number of activities at the next lower level, so that the computational cost of finding the correct way to arrange those activities for the current problem is small 
 the parameters are as follows: N is the prior probability that a candy comes from bag N; qfN and qfN are the probabilities that the flavor is cherry, given that the candy comes from bag N and bag N respectively; owl and qwN give the probabilities that the wrapper is red; and qhN and qhN give the probabilities that the candy has a hole 
 NN one might suppose that the syntactic distinction between unboxed links and singly boxed links in semantic networks is unnecessary, because singly boxed links are always attached to categories; an inheritance algorithm could simply assume that an unboxed link attached to a category is intended to apply to all members of that category 
 the successor-state axiom for the agent's location says that the agent is at y after executing an action either if the action is possible and consists of moving to y or if the agent was already at y and the action is not a move to somewhere else: poss (a, s) + (at(agent, y, result(a, s)) # a = go(x, y) v (at(agentN yl s) a a # go(y, N)) 
 for example, from the state in(arad), the successor function for the romania problem would return {( go(sibzu), in(sibiu)) , (go( timisoara), in( tzmisoara)), (go(zerznd), in(zerind))) together, the initial state and successor function implicitly define the state space of the problem-the set of all states reachable from the initial state 
 we will not give a proof here; we merely state the following result: given three noncollinear points ml, mN, and mN in the model, and their scaled orthographic projections pl, pN, and pN on the image plane, there exist exactly two transformations from the three-dimensional model coordinate frame to a twodimensional image coordinate frame 
 for example, if a customer orders a computer, is it matched with the right peripherals? if a digital camera is ordered, does it have the right meimory card and batteries? write a kinowledge base that will decide whether a set of items is compatible and that can be used to suggest replacements or additional items if they are not compatible 
 NNN-present) o what are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions? what can be computed? e how do we reason with uncertain information? philosophers staked out most of the important ideas of kN, but the leap to a formal science required a level of mathematical formalization in three fundamt:ntal areas: logic, computation, and probability 
 is there a way to find the most likely one, short of enumerating all of them? one approach we could try is the following linear-time procedure: use the smoothing algorithm to find the posterior distribution for the weather alt each time step; then construct the sequence, using at each step the weather most likely according to the posterior 
 agent programs the agent programs that we will design in this book all have the same skeleton: they take the current percept as input from the sensors and return an action to the actuatomN notice the difference between the agent program, which takes the current percept as input, and the agent function, which takes the entire percept history 
 for example, in an environment with two logical agents a and b, they could both have the following definition: b'p, s feasible(p, s) * commonknowledge( [a, b), achzeves(p, s, goal)) this says that in any situation s, the plan p is a feasible joint plan in that situation if it is common knowledge among the agents that p will achieve the goal 
 one way to make soft thresholds is to use the integral of the standard normal distribution: then the probability of buys given cost might be p(buys i cost = c) = @((-c + p)/a) which means that the cost threshold occurs around p, the width of the threshold region is proportional to a, and the probability of buying decreases as cost increases 
 or we could prolong packed forest the mystery a little longer and represent the parses with a structure called a packed forest, which looks like this: is: [s: { [np: fall leaves] [ vp: fall] [np , spring leaves] [ vp: spring] [np: fall] [ vp: leaves fall] [np spring] [ vp: leaves spring] the idea is that each node can be either a regular pa 
 rather than repeat the proof here, we simply illustrate the lemma: cN = p(x, f(x, a)) v lq(x, a) v r(x, b) cN = ln(g(y), N) v p(h(y), N) c: = lp(h(b), f(h(b), a)) v Nq(h(b), a) v r(h(b), b) c; = ln(g(b)y f(h(b), a)) v p(h(b), f(h(b), a)) c' = in(g(b), f(h(b), a)) v iq(m(b), a) v r(h(b), b) c = ln(g(y), f(h(y), a)) v lq(h(y), a) v r(h(y), b) 
 the eagle-eyed reader will have noticed something odd: backjumping occurs when every value in a domain is in conflict with the current assignment; but forward checking detects this event and prevents the search from ever reaching such a node! in fact, it can be shown that every branch pruned by backjumping is aNNN pruned by lorward checking 
 a restricted form of linear resolution called sl-resolution was developed by kowalsh and kuehner (NNNN), building on loveland's model elimination technique (NNNN); when apsld-resolution plied to definite clauses, it becomes sld-resolution, which lends itself to the interpretation of definite clauses as programs (kowalski, NNNN, NNNNa, NNNNb) 
 first, some terminology: the assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, weak ai perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the weak aN hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simustrong ai lating thinking) is called the strong aN hypothesis 
 the basic adea is the following: each image pixel can be associated with certain visual properties, such as brightness, color, and texturcN within an object, or a single part of an object, these attributes vary relatively little, whereas across an inter-object boundary there is typically a large change in one or the other of these attributes 
 try these same algorithms on map-coloring problems generated randomly as follows: scatter n points on the unit square; selecting a point x at random, connect x by a straight line to the nearest point y such that x is not already connected to y and the line crosses no other line; repeat the previous step until no more connections are possible 
 " instead, it reaches the weaker conclusion "plan ago will get us to the airport in time, as long as my car doesn't break down or run out of gas, and i don't get into an accident, and there are no accidents on the bridge, and the plane doesn't leave early, and " none of these conditions can be deduced, so the plan's success cannot be inferred 
 now, it is true when we have very little data, we cannot hope to learn a complex and detailed model, but it seems silly to keep the hypothesis complexity fixed even when the data set grows very large! nonparametric learning in contrast to parametric learning, nonparametric learning methods allow the hypothesis complexity to grow with the data 
 this gives us something of a paradox: how can an o(nN) algorithm return an answer that might contain an exponential number of parse trees? consider an example: the sentence "fall leaves fall and spring leaves spring" is ambiguous because each word (except "and") can be either a noun or a verb, and "fall" and "spring" can be adjectives as well 
 this is simple, and it guarantees that the knowledge base will be consistent, but retracting pi requires retracting and reasserting n - i sentences as well as lN belief revision is often contrasted with belief update, which occurs when a knowledge base is revised to reflect a change in the world rather than new information about a fixed world 
 for example, if the N-puzzle actions are described as a tile can move from square a to square b if a is horizontally or vertically adjacent to b an(d b is blank, in chapters N and NN, we will describe formal languages suitable for this task; with formal descriptions that can be manipulated, the construction of relaxed problems can be automated 
 as an example of rough translation, the sy stran trandation service translated the first paragraph of this chapter into italian and back to english as follows: italian: in capitolN NN abbiamo visto come un agente potrebbe comunicare con un altro agente (essere umano o software) che usando le espressioni in un linguaggio reciprocamente accordato

 execution monitoring and replanning N execution monitoring and replanning: in this approach, the agent can use any of the preceding planning techniques (classical, sensorless, or conditional) to construct a plan, but it also uses execution monitoring to judge whether the plan has a provision for the actual current situation or need to be revised

 readings in knowledge representation (brachman and levesque, NNNN) and formal theol-ies of the commonsense world (hobbs and moore, NNNN) are excellent anthologies on knowledge representation; the former focuses more on historically important papers in represenlation languages and formalisms, the latter on the accumulation of the knowledge itself 
 the question of semantics arose quite acutely with respect to quillian's semantic networks (and those of others who followed his approach), with their ubiquitous and very vague "is-a links," as well as other early knowledge representation formalisms such as that of merlin (moore and newell, NNNN) with its mysterious "flat" and "cover" operations 
 turing (NNNNN) wrote a research report titled intelligent machinery that begins with the sentence "i propose lo investigate the question as to whether it is possible for machinery to show intelligsnt behaviour" and goes on to describe a recurrent neural network architecture he called "b-type unorganized machines" and an approach to training them

 as an example, here is a prolog program for append (x, y, z ) , which succeeds if list z is the result of appending lists x and y: in english, we can read these clauses as (N) appending an empty list with a list y produces the same list y and (N) [a i z i is the result of appending [a N xi onto y, provided that z is the result of appending x onto y 
 making simple decisions qualitative probabilistic networks representation theorems present them here, there exist algorithms for propagating this kind of qualitative information among uncertain variables in qualitative probabilistic networks, enabling a system to make rational decisions based on stochastic dominance, without using any numeric values 
 the unsmoothed model has the advantage that it is easier to compute for collections with many documents: if we create an index that lists which documents mention each word, then we can quickly generate a result set by intersecting these lists, and we need to compute p(qidi) only for those documents in the intersection, rather than for every document 
 this is as it should be, because the outcomes of actions do depend on the actual world, but how do we check the truth of those conditions when all we have is the belief state? if the agent knows a proposition, say k(atr), in the current belief state, then the proposition must be true in the current physical state, and indeed the action is applicable 
 we will be finding models of propositional sentences that look like this: initial state /\ all possible action descriptions a goal the sentence will contain proposition symbols corresponding to every possible action occurrence; a model that satisfies the sentence will assign true to the actions that are part of a correct plan and false to the others 
 essentially, we have divided the problem into two parts: first we use the translation model p(f i e) to find candidate french sentences that mention the right concepts from the english sentence, but that might not be fluent french; then we use the language model p(f) (for which we have much better probability estimates) to pick out the best candidate 
 N has pioneered many ideas that have made their way back to mainstream computer science, including time sharing, interactive interpreters, personal computers with windows and mice, rapid development environments, the linked list data type, automatic storage management, and key concepts of symbolic, functional, dynamic, and object-oriented programming 
 netl (fahlman, NNNN) was a sophisticated semantic network system whose is-a links (called "virtual copy," or vc, links) were based more on the notion of "inheritance" characteristic of frame systems or of object-oriented programming languages than on the subset relation and were much more precisely defined than quillian's links from the pre-woods era 
 then as long as neither player has played testify, then at any point in time the expected future total payoff for each player is a player who chooses testify will gain a score of N rather than - N on the very next move, but his or her total expected future payoff becomes therefore, at every step, there is no incentive to deviate from (refuse, refuse) 
 his paper ends with the remark "if information value theory and associated decision theoretic structures do not in the future occupy a large part of the education of engineers, then the engineering profession will find that its traditional role of managing scientific and economic resources for the benefit of man has been forfeited to another profession 
 introduction in aN have taken place under the name of control theory, or operations research, or decision theory, which, after all, have objectives similar to those of ai? or why isn't aN a branch of mathematics? the first answer is that aN from the start embraced the idea of duplicating human faculties like creativity, self-improvement, and language use 
 successful agents split the task of computing the agent function into three different periods: when the agent is being designed, some of the computation is done by its designers; when it is deliberating on its next action, the agent does more computation; and as it learns from experience, it does even more computation to decide how to modify its behavior 
 what happens to the performance of rbfs when a small random number is added to the heuristic values in the N-puzzle domain? constraint N satisfaction problems in which we see how treating states as more than just little black boxes leads to the invention of a range ofpowe&l new search methods and a deeper understanding of problem structure and complexity

 the first is the problem of free will free will: how can it be that a purely physical mind, whose every transformation is governed strictly by the laws of physics, still retains any freedom of choice? most philosophers regard this problem as requiring a careful reconstitution of our naive notion of free will, rather than presenting any threat to materialism 
 modern analytic philosophy has typically accepted materialism (often in the form of the brain-state identity theory (place, NNNN; armstrong, NNNN), which asserts that mental states are identical with brain states), but has been much more divided on functionalism, the machine analogy for the human mind, and the question of whether machines can literally think 
 ) in ai, where the graph is represented implicitly by the initial state and successor function and is frequently infinite, branchingfactor complexity is expressed in terms of three quantities: NN, the branching factor or maximum number of successors of any node; d, the depth of the shallowest goal node; and m, the maximum length of any path in the state space

 pascal used probability in ways that required both the objective interpretation, as a property of the world based on symmetry or relative frequency, alnd the subjective interpretation, based on degree of belief-the former in his analyses of probabilities in games of clhance, the latter in the famous "pascal's wager" argument about the possible existence of god 
 the approach we have taken in this section is "plan first, schedule later": that is, we divided the overall problem into a planning phase in which actions are selected and partially ordered to meet the goals of the problem, and a later scheduling phase, in which temporal information is added to the plan to ensure that it meets resource and deadline constraints 
 but from a prolog point of view it is worrisome: q never appears on the left hand side of an arrow, so how can it be a consequence? stable model an alternative is the idea of a stable model, which is a minimal model whcre every justification atom in the model has a justification: a rule where the head is the atom and where every literal in the body is satisfied 
 for certain tasks, however--especially "novel" conjunctive goals-the pure htn viewpoint is rather unnatural, and we prefer to take a hybrid approach in which action decompositions are used as plan refinements in partial-order planning, in addition to the standard operations of establishing an open condition and resolving conflicts by adding ordering constraints 
 each layer consisted of several planes of NN, x n arrays, where n is smaller than the previous layer so that the network is down-sampling the input, and where the weights of every unit in a plane are constrained to be identical, so that the plane is acting as a feature detector: it can pick out a feature such as a long vertical line or el short semi-circular arc 
 for now, let us deal with a simplified model of the world wherein the objects have no surface marks and the lines due to illumination discontinuities, such as shadow edges and specularities, have been removed in some preprocessing step, enabling us to limit our attention to line drawings where each line corresponds to either a depth or an orientation discontinuity 
 hence, from axiom N, we can derive the following simple relationship: the probability of a proposition is equal to the sum ofthe probabilities of the atomic events in which it holds; that is, this equation provides a simple method for computing the probability of any proposition, given a full joint distribution that specifies the probabilities of all atomic events 
 learning probabilities for machine translation we have outlined a model for p(f i e) that involves four sets of parameters: language model: p(wordi i wordipl) fertility model: p(fertiNity = n(wordf) word choice model: p(worde i wordf) offset model: p(oNset = olpos, lene, lenf) even with a modest vocabulary of N,NNN words, this model requires millions of parameters 
 NN this sounds wonderful in principle, until one realizes that it can only have one of two consequences: either hard problems cannot be stated at all, or they require exponentially large descriptions! however, the tractability results do shed light on what sorts of constructs (cause problems and thus help the user to understand how different representation, behave 
 in the previous section, we looked at the question "given a game, what is a rational strategy?" in this section, we ask "given that agents are rational, what game should we design?" more specifically, we would like to design a game whose solutions, consisting of each agent pursuing its own rational strategy, result in the maximization of some global utility function 
 the question should therefore be "who is at fault if the diagnosis is unreasonable?" so far, courts have held that medical expert systems play the same role as medical textbooks and reference books; physicians are responsible for understanding the reasoning behind any decision and for using their own judgment in deciding whether to accept the system's recommendations 
 we will examine the approach via the following example, a program to compute the sum of a sequence of numbers: function suo(sequence) returns a number sum + N for i +- N to lt(sequence) sum t sum + sequence[i] return sum the first step in the analysis is to abstract over tlie input, in order to find some parameter or parameters that characterize the size of the input 
 describing planning problems in propositional logic the process we will follow to translate strips problems into propositional logic is a textbook example (so to speak) of the knowledge representation cycle: we will begin with what seems to be a reasonable set of axioms, we will find that these axioms allow for spurious unintended models, and we will write more axioms 
 does an agent a (the taxi driver for example) have to treat an object b (another vehicle) as an agent, or can it be treated merely as a stochastically behaving object, analogous to waves at the beach or leaves blowing in the wind? the key distinction is whether b's behavior is best described as maximizing a performance measure whose value depends on agent a's behavior

 the most important point is that, with complete data, the maximum-likelihood parameter learning problem for a bayesian network decomposes into separate learning problems, one for each parametezN the second point is that the parameter values for a variable, given its parents, are just the observed frequencies of the variable values for each setting of the parent values 
 the training examples consist of pairs of word strings and corresponding queries-for example; what is the capital of the state with the largest population? answer(c, capital (s, c) a largest (p, state (s) a population(s, p))) chill's task is to learn a predicate parse(words, query) that is consistent with the examples and, hopefully, generalizes well to other examples

 if it were to try to consider actions at the level of "move the left foot forward an inch" or "turn the steering wheel one degree left," the agent would probably never find its way out of the parking lot, let alone to bucharest, because at that level of detail there is too much uncertainty in the problem formulation world and there would be too many steps in a solution

 thus, when researchers first began to use computers to analyze language in the NNNNs they were quite surprised to learn that almost every utterance is highly ambiguous, even though the alternative interpretations might not be apparent to a native speaker: a system with a large grammar and lexicon might find thousands of interpretations for a perfectly ordinary sentence 
 compare the sirnple state description we have chosen, in(arad), to an actual cross-country trip, where the state of the world includes so many things: the traveling companions, what is on the radio, the scenery out of the window, whether there are any law enforcement officers nearby, how far lit is to the next rest stop, the condition of the road, the weather, and so on 
 in particular, he showed that speech production was localized to a portion of the left hemisphere now called neurons broca's areaN by that time, it was known that the brain consisted of nerve cells or neurons, but it was not until NNNN that carnillo golgi (NNNN-NNNN) developed a staining technique allowing the observation of individual neurons in the brain (see figure N 
 this form of reasoning ranges from a form of plausible reasoning based on degree of similarity (gentner, NNNN), through a form of deductive inference based on determinations but requiring the participation of the example (davies and russell, NNNN), to a form of "lazy" ebl that tailors the direction of generalization of the old example to fit the needs of the new problem

 by the definition of the experiment, the subject's external behavior must remain unchanged compared with what would be observed if the operation were not carried now although the presence or absence of consciousness cannot easily be ascertained by a third party, the subject of the experiment ought at least to be able to record any changes in his or her own conscious experience 
 eliminative materialism eliminative materialism (rorty, NNNN; churchlancl, NNNN) differs from all other prominent theories in the philosophy of mind, in that it ldoes not attempt to give an account of why our "folk psychology" or commonsense ideas about the mind are true, but instead rejects them as false and attempts to replace them with a purely scientific theory of the mind 
 ), the cost to get from the node to the goal: since g(n) gives the path cost from the start node to node n, and h(n) is the estirnated cost of the cheapest path from n to the goal, we have f (n) = estimated cost of the cheapest solution through n thus, if we are trying to find the cheapest solution, a reasonable thing to try first is the node with the lowest value of g(n) + h(n) 
 in david lodge's small world (NNNN), a novel about the academic world of literary criticism, the protagonist causes consternation by asking a panel of eminent but contradictory literary theorists the following question: "what ifyou were right?" none of the theorists seems to have considered this question before, perhaps because debating unfalsifiable theories is an end in itself

 the word "game" and the simplification to single moves might make this seem trivial, but in fact, game theory is used in very serious decision making situations including bankruptcy proceedings, the auctioning of wireless frequency spectrums, product development and pricing decisions, and national defense, situations involving billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives

 notice that decision making of this kind is fundamentally different from the conditionaction rules described earlier, in that it involves consideration of the future-both "what will happen if i do such-and-such?' and "will that make me happy?'in the reflex agent designs, this information is not explicitly represented, because the built-in rules map directly from percepts to actions

 the gain ratio criterion selects attributes according to the ratio between their gain and their intrinsic information content-that is, the amount of information contained in the answer to the question, "what is the value of this attribute?" the gain ratio criterion therefore tries to measure how efficiently an attribute pro\ides information on the correct classification of an example 
 this second property is also true of the equation for the separator itself; once the optimal a,s have been calculated, it is h(x) = sign aiyi(x xi) (i i a final important property of the optimal separator defined by this equation is that the weights ai associated with each data point are zero except for those points closest to the separatorsupport vector the so-called support vectors

 here is the bracketing it discovers for one sentence within a larger text of news stories: [most labour] [sentiment [[would still] [favor the] abolition]] [[of [the house]] [of lords]] it has correctly picked out constituents such as the pp "of the house of lords," although it also goes against traditional analysis in, for example, grouping "the" with the preceding verb rather than the following noun 
 the axiom for holding says that the agent is holding g after executing an action if the action was a grab of g and the grab is possible or if the agent was already holding g, and the action is not releasing it: successor-state axioms solve the representational frame problem because the total size of the axioms is o(ae) literals: each of the e effects of each of the a actions is mentioned exactly once 
 thus, the forward operator for kalman filtering takes a gaussian forward message fl t, specified by a mean pt and covariance matrix xt, and produces a new multivariate gaussian forward message fl,t+l, specified by a mean pt+ and covariance matrix so, if we start with a gaussian prior fl:o = p(xo) = n(pa, xo)? lfilteririg with a linear gaussian model produces a gaussian state distribution for all time

 for finding pits, the obvious diagnostic rules say that if a square is breezy, some adjacent square must contain a pit, or 'd s breezy(s) =s- N r adjacent (r, s) a pit(r) , and that if a square is not breezy, no adjacent square contains a pit: lo b' s N breezy (s) + NN r adjacent (r, s) l'\ pit (,r) combining these two, we obtain the biconditional sentence b' s breezy (s) # N r adjacent(r, s) a pit (r) 
 the fundamental question is the following: given the fact that, during perspective projection, all points in the three-dimensional world along a ray from the pinhole have been projected to the same point in the image, how do we recover three-dimensional information? there are a number of cues available in the visual stimulus for this, including motion, binocular stereopsis, texture, shading, and contour 
 these abstract states are supposed to be independent of the specific physical composition of the brain, leading some to charge that functional state identity theory is a form of dualism! both the brain-state identity theory and the various forms of functionalism have come under attack from authors who claim that they do not account for the qualia or "what it's like" aspect of mental states (nagel, NNNN) 
 when a physician relies on the judgment of a medical expert system for a diagnosis, who is at fault if the diagnosis is wrong? fortunately, due in part to the growing influence of decision-theoretic methods in medicine, it is now accepted that negligence cannot be shown if the physician performs medical procedures that have high expected utility, even if the actual result is catastrophic for the patient 
 for example, an agent that has to spot defective parts on an assembly line bases each decision on the current part, regardless of previous decisions; moreover, the current decision doesn't affect whether the next the first edition of this book used the terms accessible and inaccessible instead of fully and partially observable; nondeterministic instead of stochastic; and nonepisodic instead of sequential 
 a big advantage of the bigram model is that it is easy to train the model by counting the number of times each word pair occurs in a representative corpus of strings and using the strictly speaking, the probability of a word sequence depends strongly on the context of the utterance; for example, "i have a gun" is much more common on notes passed to a bank teller than it is in, say, the wall street journal

 this is disconcerting to many people (including turing himself), who have the intuition that lookup tables are not conscious-or at least, that the conscious experiences generated during table lookup are not the same as those generated during the operation of a system that might be described (even in a simple-minded, computational sense) as accessing and generating beliefs, introspections, goals, and so on

 there are two closely related families of systems: semartic netvvorks provide graphical aids for visualizing a knowledge base and efficient algorithms for inferring properties of an object on the basis of its category membership; and description logics provide a formal language for constructing and combining category definitions and efficient algorithms for deciding subset and superset relationships between categories 
 ail agent in a deterministic environment is said to have a value function or ordinal utility fiinctioa; the function really provides just rankings of states rather than meaningful nunlerical values we saw this distinction in chapter N for games: evaluation functions in deterministic games such as chess are value functions, whereas evaluation functions in nondeterministic games like backgammon are true utility functions

 after all, why should maximizing the average utility be so special? why not try to maximize the sum of the cubes of the possible utilities, or try to minimize the worst possible loss? also, couldn't an agent act rationally just by expressing preferences between states, without giving them numeric values? finally, why should a utility function with the required properties exist at all? perhaps a rational agent can have a preference structure that is too complex to be captured by something as simple as a single real number for each state

 the relationship can also be numerical: for example, if the parent nodes are the prices of a particular model of car at several dealers, and the child node is the price that a bargain hunter ends up paying, then the child node is the minimum of the parent values; or if the parent nodes are the inflows (rivers, runoff, precipitation) into a lake and the outflows (livers, evaporation, seepage) from the lake and the child is the change in the water level of the lake, then the value of the child is the difference between the inflow parents and the outflow parents 
 the utility function u(s) allows the agent to select actions by using the maximum expected utility principle from chapter NN-that is, choose: the action that maximizes the expected utility of the subsequent state: now, if the utility of a state is the expected sum of discounted rewards from that point onwards, then there is a direct relationship between the utility of a state and the utility of its neighbors: the utility of a state is the immediate reward for that state plus the expected discounted utility of the next state, assuming that the agent chooses the optimal action
